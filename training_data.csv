0;Women at a dangerous intersection: diagnosis and treatment of depression and related disorders in patients with breast cancer.;Abstract Breast cancer is a relatively common diagnosis for American women and depressive symptoms occur in many women with breast cancer. Identification of women with breast cancer and concomitant depressive symptoms and mood disorders requires particular attention by heath care providers, and may be aided by the administration of a variety of diagnostic and/or screening tools. Insomnia is also a significant problem for women with breast cancer at various stages of diagnosis and treatment, including after remission. Although many studies on the treatment of depression in women with breast cancer have been done, and the data do point to the efficacy of several antidepressants in this population, there are no data to support the widely held hypothesis that treatment of depression in patients with breast cancer may positively affect morbidity and mortality. Breast cancer treatments may give rise to depressive symptoms and this should be considered in the approach to pharmacotherapy. Several psychotherapeutic modalities offer relief of the symptoms and syndromes of depression in breast cancer. Future research can answer the question of which approach is most appropriate for which patients, and whether therapy can improve a variety of health outcomes and survival for women with breast cancer.;Psychiatr Clin North Am. 2010 Jun.33(2):409-22. doi: 10.1016/j.psc.2010.01.005.;Weinberger T1, Forrester A, Markov D, Chism K, Kunkel EJ.;Review,Adult,Affect/drug effects,Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/adverse effects,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy,Breast Neoplasms/psychology*,Depression/diagnosis*,Depression/drug therapy,Depression/etiology,Depression/therapy*,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Psychotherapy/methods,Sleep Wake Disorders/diagnosis*,Sleep Wake Disorders/drug therapy,Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology,Sleep Wake Disorders/therapy*,Time Factors,Treatment Outcome,Antidepressive Agents,Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Why worry about awareness in choice problems? Econometric analysis of screening for cervical cancer.;Abstract The decision to undertake a screening test is conditional upon awareness of screening. From an econometric perspective there is a potential selection problem, if no distinction is made between aware and unaware non-screeners. This paper explores this problem through analysis of the determinants of cervical screening in Australia. Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable and curable forms of cancer. Since 1991 there has been a concerted effort in Australia to recommend and encourage women to have Pap smears every two years. The success of this program can be partly gauged by exploring the determinants of screening for cervical cancer. Using unit record data from the 1995 National Health Survey, an econometric model is developed for whether women have ever screened or not. A proportion of women in the sample contend that they have never heard of a Pap test. The analysis characterizes this group of women and accounts for their presence in the modelling. The paper demonstrates failing to model awareness can result in inconsistent parameter estimates even when the degree of censoring in the sample is relatively small.;Health Econ. 2006 Jan.15(1):33-47.;Belkar R1, Fiebig DG, Haas M, Viney R.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Australia,Choice Behavior,Female,Health Care Surveys,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice*,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/utilization*,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric*,National Health Programs,Papanicolaou Test*,Patient Acceptance of Health Care*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Vaginal Smears/economics,Vaginal Smears/utilization*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

0;Why did the breast cancer lymph node status distribution improve in Denmark in the pre-mammography screening period of 1978-1994?;Abstract BACKGROUND: Danish breast cancer patients diagnosed in 1978-1994 experienced a trend over time towards a more favourable distribution of lymph node status at time of diagnosis, which was not due to mammography screening. We investigated how this trend could be explained by patient characteristics at diagnosis: age (biological processes), calendar period (e.g. environmental changes), birth cohort (living conditions over a life time), post-menopausal status (a predictor of less favourable nodal status), and tumour diameter (a marker of detection time). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data set consisted of 22 955 patients aged 30-69 years at time of diagnosis with known lymph node status, known tumour diameter, known menopausal status, and clinically detected tumours, available from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG). Age, period, cohort, menopausal status, and tumour diameter were used as predictors in generalised linear models with either node-positive status (at least one of the excised lymph nodes being tumour-positive) or severely node-positive status (at least half of the excised lymph nodes being tumour-positive) as outcomes. Lymph node status was assessed both empirically and estimated using an EM algorithm in order to reduce misclassification. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We found that the improved lymph node status distribution was most likely a period effect due to a combination of earlier detection of clinical tumours, explaining most of the trend in node-positive breast cancer and half of the trend in severely node-positive breast cancer, and some unknown factor affecting lymph node status but not necessarily other tumour characteristics.;Acta Oncol. 2010 Apr.49(3):313-21. doi: 10.3109/02841861003602074.;Rostgaard K1, Vaeth M, Rootzén H, Lynge E.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Denmark/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Incidence,Linear Models,Lymph Nodes/pathology*,Lymphatic Metastasis,Mammography,Mass Screening*/methods,Menopause,Middle Aged,Odds Ratio,Predictive Value of Tests,Prognosis,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Time Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;When should active surveillance for prostate cancer stop if no progression is detected?;Abstract BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of screen-detected men with prostate cancer may be overdiagnosed. Active Surveillance (AS) has emerged as a way to mitigate this problem, by delaying treatment of men, who are at low-risk until this becomes necessary. However, it is not known after how much time or biopsy rounds should patients stop AS and transition to conservative management (CM), if no progression is detected. METHODS: We used a microsimulation model with natural history of prostate cancer based on ERSPC and SEER data. We modeled referral to treatment while in AS, based on Johns Hopkins treatment-free survival data. We projected lifetime costs and effects of AS (and radical treatment, if progression is detected) under different biopsy follow-up schedules compared to CM, where radical treatment only occurs when men would be clinically diagnosed in absence of screening. RESULTS: For men with low-risk disease in younger age groups (55-65), AS is cost-effective for up to 7 yearly biopsy rounds. For men older than 65, even one biopsy round results in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, though it may result in QALYs gained for men without previous screening. For men with intermediate-risk disease AS is cost-effective even for men in 65-75 age group. CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of AS when compared to CM is strongly dependent on life expectancy and disease risk. Clinicians should take this into account when selecting men to AS, deciding on biopsy frequency and when to stop AS surveillance rounds and transition to CM. � 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;Prostate. 2017 Jun.77(9):962-969. doi: 10.1002/pros.23352.

0;What might explain deprivation-specific differences in the excess hazard of breast cancer death amongst screen-detected women? Analysis of patients diagnosed in the West Midlands region of England from 1989 to 2011.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survival is higher in less deprived women, even amongst women whose tumor was screen-detected, but reasons behind this have not been comprehensively investigated. METHODS: The excess hazard of breast cancer death in 20,265 women diagnosed with breast cancer, followed up to 2012, was estimated for screen-detected and non-screen-detected women, comparing more deprived to less deprived women using flexible parametric models. Models were adjusted for individual and tumor factors, treatment received and comorbidity. For screen-detected women, estimates were also corrected for lead-time and overdiagnosis. RESULTS: The excess hazard ratio (EHR) of breast cancer death in the most deprived group, adjusted only for age and year of diagnosis, was twice that of the least deprived among screen-detected women (EHR=2.12, 95%CI 1.48-2.76) and 64% higher among non-screen-detected women (EHR=1.64, 95%CI 1.41-1.87). Adjustment for stage at diagnosis lowered these estimates by 25%. Further adjustment had little extra impact. In the final models, the excess hazard for the most deprived women was 54% higher (EHR=1.54, 95%CI 1.10-1.98) among screen-detected women and 39% higher (EHR=1.39, 95%CI 1.20-1.59) among non-screen-detected women. CONCLUSION: A persistent socio-economic gradient in breast cancer-related death exists in this cohort, even for screen-detected women. The impact of differential lifestyles, management and treatment warrant further investigation.;Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 2.7(31):49939-49947. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10255.;Morris M1, Woods LM1, Rachet B1.;Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Comorbidity,Early Detection of Cancer,England/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Medical Overuse,Middle Aged,Proportional Hazards Models,Sensitivity and Specificity,Social Class,Socioeconomic Factors,Survival Analysis,11700/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;What happens when organization of cervical cancer screening is delayed or stopped?;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Many countries rely on opportunistic screening, and data on its effectiveness are asked for. We assessed the impact on cervical cancer incidence and mortality of opportunistic screening compared with organized screening. SETTING: Women aged 30-64 in Denmark, 1973-2002. 16 counties with different screening strategies. METHODS: Cumulative incidence and mortality rates for women aged 30-64 by county. Poisson regression of incidence and mortality rates by age, calendar period and county. Interaction between type of county and calendar period measured the difference between counties with screening organized early versus late in time. RESULTS: A statistically significant interaction was found between type of county and calendar period (P=0.0151) for cervical cancer incidence, but not for cervical cancer mortality (P=0.9593). The interaction terms were not statistically significant when a comparison was made between a single county in which an organized programme was interrupted for an 11-year period and other counties. There was, however, a statistically significant increased incidence and mortality rates at the restart of the organized programme. CONCLUSION: Organization of cervical cancer screening accelerated the decline in cervical cancer incidence, compared with the trend in areas relying on opportunistic screening. No impact could be measured of the screening organization on cervical cancer mortality. A decade long stop of an organized screening programme was associated with a temporary increase in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Coverage remains a key quality indicator in the ongoing modernization of screening technology.;J Med Screen. 2006.13(1):41-6.;Lynge E1, Clausen LB, Guignard R, Poll P.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Precancerous Conditions,Risk Factors,Risk Management,Time Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Vasectomy and risk of aggressive prostate cancer: a 24-year follow-up study.;Abstract PURPOSE: Conflicting reports remain regarding the association between vasectomy, a common form of male contraception in the United States, and prostate cancer risk. We examined prospectively this association with extended follow-up and an emphasis on advanced and lethal disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 49,405 U.S. men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, age 40 to 75 years at baseline in 1986, 6,023 patients with prostate cancer were diagnosed during the follow-up to 2010, including 811 lethal cases. In total, 12,321 men (25%) had vasectomies. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% CIs of total, advanced, high-grade, and lethal disease, with adjustment for a variety of possible confounders. RESULTS: Vasectomy was associated with a small increased risk of prostate cancer overall (RR, 1.10. 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.17). Risk was elevated for high-grade (Gleason score 8 to 10. RR, 1.22. 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.45) and lethal disease (death or distant metastasis. RR, 1.19. 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.43). Among a subcohort of men receiving regular prostate-specific antigen screening, the association with lethal cancer was stronger (RR, 1.56. 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.36). Vasectomy was not associated with the risk of low-grade or localized disease. Additional analyses suggested that the associations were not driven by differences in sex hormone levels, sexually transmitted infections, or cancer treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data support the hypothesis that vasectomy is associated with a modest increased incidence of lethal prostate cancer. The results do not appear to be due to detection bias, and confounding by infections or cancer treatment is unlikely.;J Clin Oncol. 2014 Sep 20.32(27):3033-8.;Siddiqui MM, Wilson KM, Epstein MM, Rider JR, Martin NE, Stampfer MJ, Giovannucci EL, Mucci LA.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Aged,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Incidence,Male,Middle Aged,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality,Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology*,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,United States/epidemiology,Vasectomy/adverse effects*,CA133891/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,UM1CA167552-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P01 CA055075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,CA141298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,T32 CA09001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA133891/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,T32 CA009001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,UM1 CA167552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA141298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Variations in survival for invasive cervical cancer among European women, 1978-89. EUROCARE Working Group.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To analyze cervical cancer survival trends in 10 European countries using models that estimate the proportion of cured patients (having the same life expectancy as the general population) and the survival of fatal cases (who die from cervical cancer). METHODS: We considered 40,906 cases diagnosed over 12 years (1978-89) collected from cancer registries participating in EUROCARE. RESULTS: From 1978 to 1989, 5-year relative survival in Europe improved (60%-->63%). The proportion of cured patients increased slightly but significantly (53%-->55%, p = 0.05). For countries with poorer survival at the end of the 1970s the proportion of cured patients increased faster than average, particularly evident in England (49%-->56%) and Scotland (44%-->53%). By contrast, in Finland, Sweden and Germany with organized screening, 5-year survival and cure rate did not improve, but incidence declined to very low levels. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical screening can explain the trends in cervical cancer survival: this identifies premalignant lesions, reduces incidence and selectively prevents less aggressive cancers. The decreased proportion of the latter means that survival does not improve in countries with low incidence of cervical cancer. The increased proportion of cured patients with time shows that survival improvement was not due simply to earlier diagnosis with no patient advantage.;Cancer Causes Control. 1999 Dec.10(6):575-81.;Gatta G1, Capocaccia R, Hakulinen T, Sant M, Verdecchia A, De Angelis G, Micheli A, Berrino F.;Multicenter Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Europe/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Linear Models,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Registries,Risk Factors,Survival Analysis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Vaginal Smears;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Variance estimation and confidence intervals for the standardized mortality ratio with application to the assessment of a cancer screening program.;Abstract The effect of a cancer screening program can be measured through the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) statistic. The numerator of the SMR is the observed number of deaths from the screened disease among participants in the screening program, whereas the denominator of the SMR is an estimate of the expected number of deaths in these participants under the assumption that the screening program has no effect. In this article, we propose a variance estimator for the denominator of the SMR when this expected number of deaths is estimated with Sasieni's method. We give both a general formula for this variance as well as formulas for specific disease incidence and survival estimators. We show how this new variance estimator can be used to build confidence intervals for the SMR. We investigate the coverage properties of various types of confidence intervals by simulation and find that intervals that make use of the proposed variance estimator perform well. We illustrate the method by applying it to the Québec Breast Cancer Screening program.;Stat Med. 2011 Nov 10.30(25):3024-37. doi: 10.1002/sim.4334.

1;Value Of Waiving Coinsurance For Colorectal Cancer Screening In Medicare Beneficiaries.;Abstract Financial barriers to colorectal cancer screening persist despite the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Medicare beneficiaries may face 20 percent coinsurance for a screening colonoscopy when the procedure includes the removal of polyps or follows a positive fecal screening test. Using an established microsimulation model, we estimated that waiving this coinsurance would result in 1.7 fewer colorectal cancer deaths (a decrease of 13 percent) and $17,000 higher colorectal cancer-related costs (an increase of 0.6 percent) for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services per 1,000 sixty-five-year-olds, assuming a 10-percentage-point increase in the rates of first colonoscopy screening, follow-up, and surveillance. If the rates did not change, waiving coinsurance would increase total costs by $51,000 (1.9 percent) per 1,000 sixty-five-year-olds. Estimated screening benefits were comparable when fecal testing was assumed to be the primary screening method. Moreover, waiving coinsurance would be cost-effective if the screening rate increased by 0.6 percentage points, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Thus, the waiver is likely to have a favorable balance of health and cost impact.;Health Aff (Millwood). 2017 Dec.36(12):2151-2159. doi: 10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0228.;Peterse EFP1, Meester RGS2, Gini A3, Doubeni CA4, Anderson DS5, Berger FG6, Zauber AG7, Lansdorp-Vogelaar I8.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Aged,Colonoscopy/economics,Colonoscopy/statistics & numerical data,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods,Deductibles and Coinsurance/economics,Deductibles and Coinsurance/statistics & numerical data*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Medicare/economics*,Medicare/statistics & numerical data,Medicare/trends,Occult Blood,United States,P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA199335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Validity and coverage of estimates of relative accuracy.;Abstract PURPOSE: Studies comparing test accuracy often restrict the confirmation procedure to subjects classified as positive by either test. Relative sensitivity (RSN) and relative false-positive rate (RFP) are two estimable comparative measures of accuracy. This article evaluates the influence of sample size, disease prevalence, and test accuracy on the validity of point estimates of RSN and RFP, and on the coverage of their confidence intervals (CI). METHODS: For each combination of sample size, disease prevalence, test accuracy, and interdependence between tests 1,000 samples were generated using computer simulations. The percent bias in the RSN and RFP estimates was measured by comparing the means of the 1,000 values computed in each simulation (log-transformed) with their theoretical values. Coverage of the estimated CI was measured by computing the proportion that actually included the theoretical values. Application of these methods was illustrated with data from a study comparing mammography and physical examination in screening for breast cancer. RESULTS: RSN estimates were valid if the true number of diseased cases exceeded 30, and RFP estimates were valid if the number of nondiseased subjects exceeded 200. When the numbers of diseased and nondiseased subjects exceeded 150 each, the 95% CI of RSN and RFP provided adequate coverage of the parameters (95 +/- 2%). CONCLUSION: Sample size is the most important variable for the validity and coverage of RSN and RFP estimates. For small samples, validity and coverage of RSN and RFP also depend on the accuracy of each test and on the degree of interdependence between the tests.;Ann Epidemiol. 2000 May.10(4):251-60.;Cheng H1, Macaluso M, Hardin JM.;Adult,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Confidence Intervals,Epidemiologic Methods*,False Positive Reactions,Female,Humans,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Predictive Value of Tests,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Utilization of papanicolaou smears by South Asian women living in the United States.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Papanicolaou (Pap) smears are an underutilized screening modality among racial and ethnic minorities. However, no data exist on Pap smear utilization among South Asians, a rapidly growing population in the United States, whose country of origin includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. We determined rates and identified variables associated with Pap smear receipt by South Asians. DESIGN: A self-administered survey instrument was mailed to a random sample of South Asians nationwide over a 3-month time period. South Asian households were identified by surnames that were used to search white pages in telephone directories, Department of Motor Vehicle records, and voter registries. Questions regarding Pap smear receipt were taken from the 1999 National Health Interview Survey. Sociodemographic information and measures of acculturation were obtained. PARTICIPANTS: A nationwide nonprobability sample of South Asian women. INTERVENTION: Cross-sectional observational study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The overall response rate was 42%. In this sample, South Asians belonged to a high socioeconomic strata (SES), with 45% having a household income of >$80,000 and 42% having a master's degree. Three quarters of the respondents (73%) reported having a Pap smear in the last 3 years. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, South Asian women had greater odds of having had a Pap smear if they were married (P <.001), more educated (P =.004), had a usual source of care (P =.002), and were more acculturated (P =.004). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high SES of South Asian women, their rates of Pap smear receipt were lower than national recommendations. Marital status, socioeconomic status, and acculturation are all associated with Pap smear receipt. South Asian communities should be targeted for outreach to promote Pap smear utilization.;J Gen Intern Med. 2003 May.18(5):377-84.;Chaudhry S1, Fink A, Gelberg L, Brook R.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Asia, Western/ethnology,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/utilization,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Papanicolaou Test*,United States/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/ethnology,Vaginal Smears/statistics & numerical data,Vaginal Smears/utilization*,R01 HS010597/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States,1 R01 HS10597-01A2/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Using the interactive systems framework to support a quality improvement approach to dissemination of evidence-based strategies to promote early detection of breast cancer: planning a comprehensive dynamic trial.;Abstract Dissemination efforts must optimize interventions for new settings and populations. As such, dissemination research should incorporate principles of quality improvement. Comprehensive Dynamic Trial (CDT) designs examine how information gained during dissemination may be used to modify interventions and improve performance. Although CDT may offer distinct advantages over static designs, organizing the many necessary roles and activities is a significant challenge. In this article, we discuss use of the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation to systematically implement a CDT. Specifically, we describe Bronx ACCESS  a program designed to disseminate evidence-based strategies to promote adherence to mammography guidelines. In Bronx ACCESS, the Intervention Delivery System will elicit information needed to adapt strategies to specific settings and circumstances. The Intervention Synthesis and Translation System will use this information to test changes to strategies through embedded experiments. The Intervention Support System will build local capacities found to be necessary for intervention institutionalization. Simulation modeling will be used to integrate findings across systems. Results will inform on-going policy debate about interventions needed to promote population-level screening. More generally, this project is intended to advance understanding of research paradigms necessary to study dissemination.;Am J Community Psychol. 2012 Dec.50(3-4):497-517. doi: 10.1007/s10464-012-9518-6.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Using Simulation to Model and Validate Invasive Breast Cancer Progression in Women in the Study and Control Groups of the Canadian National Breast Screening Studies I and II.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Modeling breast cancer progression and the effect of various risk is helpful in deciding when a woman should start and end screening, and how often the screening should be undertaken. METHODS: We modeled the natural progression of breast cancer using a hidden Markov process, and incorporated the effects of covariates. Patients are women aged 50-59 (older) and 40-49 (younger) years from the Canadian National Breast Screening Studies. We included prevalent cancers, estimated the screening sensitivities and rates of over-diagnosis, and validated the models using simulation. RESULTS: We found that older women have a higher rate of transition from a healthy to preclinical state and other causes of death but a lower rate of transition from preclinical to clinical state. Reciprocally, younger women have a lower rate of transition from a healthy to preclinical state and other causes of death but a higher rate of transition from a preclinical to clinical state. Different risk factors were significant for the age groups. The mean sojourn times for older and younger women were 2.53 and 2.96 years, respectively. In the study group, the sensitivities of the initial physical examination and mammography for older and younger women were 0.87 and 0.81, respectively, and the sensitivity of the subsequent screens were 0.78 and 0.53, respectively. In the control groups, the sensitivities of the initial physical examination for older and younger women were 0.769 and 0.671, respectively, and the sensitivity of the subsequent physical examinations for the control group aged 50-59 years was 0.37. The upper-bounds for over-diagnosis in older and younger women were 25% and 27%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present work offers a basis for the better modeling of cancer incidence for a population with the inclusion of prevalent cancers.;Med Decis Making. 2017 Feb.37(2):212-223. doi: 10.1177/0272989X16660711.

0;Using Natural Language Processing to Extract Abnormal Results From Cancer Screening Reports.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies show that follow-up of abnormal cancer screening results, such as mammography and Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, is frequently not performed in a timely manner. A contributing factor is that abnormal results may go unrecognized because they are buried in free-text documents in electronic medical records (EMRs), and, as a result, patients are lost to follow-up. By identifying abnormal results from free-text reports in EMRs and generating alerts to clinicians, natural language processing (NLP) technology has the potential for improving patient care. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the performance of NLP software for extracting abnormal results from free-text mammography and Pap smear reports stored in an EMR. METHODS: A sample of 421 and 500 free-text mammography and Pap reports, respectively, were manually reviewed by a physician, and the results were categorized for each report. We tested the performance of NLP to extract results from the reports. The 2 assessments (criterion standard versus NLP) were compared to determine the precision, recall, and accuracy of NLP. RESULTS: When NLP was compared with manual review for mammography reports, the results were as follows: precision, 98% (96%-99%). recall, 100% (98%-100%). and accuracy, 98% (96%-99%). For Pap smear reports, the precision, recall, and accuracy of NLP were all 100%.

0;Using a genetic-fuzzy algorithm as a computer aided diagnosis tool on Saudi Arabian breast cancer database.;Abstract The computer-aided diagnosis has become one of the major research topics in medical diagnostics. In this research paper, we focus on designing an automated computer diagnosis by combining two major methodologies, namely the fuzzy base systems and the evolutionary genetic algorithms and applying them to the Saudi Arabian breast cancer diagnosis database, to be employed for assisting physicians in the early detection of breast cancers, and hence obtaining an early-computerized diagnosis complementary to that by physicians. Our hybrid algorithm, the genetic-fuzzy algorithm, has produced optimized diagnosis systems that attain high classification performance, in fact, our best three rule system obtained a 97% accuracy, with simple and well interpretive rules, and with a good degree of confidence of 91%.;Math Biosci. 2017 Apr.286:39-48. doi: 10.1016/j.mbs.2017.02.002.

1;Use of risk projection models to estimate mortality and incidence from radiation-induced breast cancer in screening programs.;Abstract The authors report on a method to calculate radiological risks, applicable to breast screening programs and other controlled medical exposures to ionizing radiation. In particular, it has been applied to make a risk assessment in the Valencian Breast Cancer Early Detection Program (VBCEDP) in Spain. This method is based on a parametric approach, through Markov processes, of hazard functions for radio-induced breast cancer incidence and mortality, with mean glandular breast dose, attained age and age-at-exposure as covariates. Excess relative risk functions of breast cancer mortality have been obtained from two different case-control studies exposed to ionizing radiation, with different follow-up time: the Canadian Fluoroscopy Cohort Study (1950--1987) and the Life Span Study (1950--1985 and 1950--1990), whereas relative risk functions for incidence have been obtained from the Life Span Study (1958--1993), the Massachusetts tuberculosis cohorts (1926--1985 and 1970--1985), the New York post-partum mastitis patients (1930--1981) and the Swedish benign breast disease cohort (1958--1987). Relative risks from these cohorts have been transported to the target population undergoing screening in the Valencian Community, a region in Spain with about four and a half million inhabitants. The SCREENRISK software has been developed to estimate radiological detriments in breast screening. Some hypotheses corresponding to different screening conditions have been considered in order to estimate the total risk associated with a woman who takes part in all screening rounds. In the case of the VBCEDP, the total radio-induced risk probability for fatal breast cancer is in a range between [5 x 10(-6), 6 x 10(-4)] versus the natural rate of dying from breast cancer in the Valencian Community which is 9.2 x 10(-3). The results show that these indicators could be included in quality control tests and could be adequate for making comparisons between several screening programs.;Phys Med Biol. 2005 Feb 7.50(3):505-20.;Ramos M1, Ferrer S, Villaescusa JI, Verdú G, Salas MD, Cuevas MD.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Age of Onset,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/etiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Case-Control Studies,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography,Markov Chains,Mass Screening,Models, Statistical,Models, Theoretical,Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis*,Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality*,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk,Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Use of Medicare claims data to measure county-level variation in breast carcinoma incidence and mammography rates.;Abstract BACKGROUND: National-level population-based data about breast carcinoma incidence and its association with screening mammography are currently not available. METHODS: Inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician/supplier Medicare claims were used to identify incident cases of breast carcinoma in women > or = 65 years from 1996 to 1997 and calculate county-level incidence rates. The 1994-1995 claims data were used to determine county-level rates of mammography, and determine the correlation with incidence. RESULTS: The median 2-year incidence rate for women > or = 65 was 979/100,000, and substantial variation in incidence between counties was observed. (i.e. 25th percentile 789/100,000, 75th percentile 1186/100,000). Two-year county-level mammography rates also varied among counties (i.e. 25th percentile 30.5%, 75th percentile 40.9%) and were higher in white women than in black women (median 36.8 and 26.3%, respectively). Counties with higher rates of mammography also had higher age-adjusted incidence rates. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare claims may provide an alternative source of population-based data, particularly for areas in which registry data are not readily available, or are of limited scope. The data highlight the geographic variation in incidence and screening rates that may be useful for targeted interventions, and also suggest that mammography remains in a growth phase.;Cancer Detect Prev. 2002.26(3):197-202.;Cooper GS1, Yuan Z, Jethva RN, Rimm AA.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Carcinoma/epidemiology*,Female,Geography,Humans,Incidence,Linear Models,Local Government,Mammography/statistics & numerical data*,Medicare/statistics & numerical data*,United States/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Use of lung cancer risk models in planning research and service programs in CT screening for lung cancer.;Abstract Computed tomography screening for lung cancer is now being tested in a number of international trials. The long-term success of the approach in the future National Screening Programme is dependent upon identifying populations at sufficient risk of lung cancer that the benefit-harm ratio of the intervention is likely to be high. There are a number of lung cancer risk prediction models currently available. We review these, and demonstrate, using the Liverpool Lung Project risk prediction model as a case study, the potential for use of a risk prediction model in the design of a randomized trial of lung cancer screening and in the planning of a service screening program.;Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2009 Oct.9(10):1467-72. doi: 10.1586/era.09.87.;Duffy SW1, Raji OY, Agbaje OF, Allgood PC, Cassidy A, Field JK.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Lung Neoplasms/etiology,Mass Screening/methods,Models, Statistical*,Program Development/methods,Risk,Risk Factors,Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods*,G9900432/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Use of forecasted assessment of quality of life to validate time-trade-off utilities and a prostate cancer screening decision-analytic model.;Abstract PURPOSE: To determine whether the forecasted assessment of how someone would feel in a future health state can be predictive of utilities (e.g. as elicited by the time-trade-off method) and also predictive of optimal decisions as determined by a decision-analytic model. METHODS: We elicited time-trade-off utilities for prostate cancer treatment outcomes from 168 men. We also elicited forecasted assessments, that is, an informal, non-quantitative, descriptive evaluation, of impotence and incontinence from these men. We used multivariate regression analysis to explore the relationship between forecasted assessment and reluctance to trade length for improved quality of life, that is, the unwillingness to trade length of life for improved quality of life in the time-trade-off utility assessment and the relationship between the forecasted assessments and the optimal decision of whether to undergo screening for prostate cancer as determined from a previously published decision-analytic model. RESULTS: Importance of sexual function was strongly related to impotence utilities (P < 0.05). Based on the multivariate analysis, significant predictors for the utility of severe incontinence were family income, family history of prostate cancer, work status and attitude towards needing to wear an incontinence pad. However, no variables were statistically significant predictors for the utility of complete impotence. The importance of sexual functioning was a significant predictor of the optimal decision. CONCLUSION: Anticipated difficulty adjusting to adverse health effects were highly related to preferences and could be used as a proxy measure of utility. Similarly, the importance of sexual functioning, a future preference, was highly related to the optimal decision, which validates our previously published decision-analytic model. � 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;Health Expect. 2015 Oct.18(5):1610-20. doi: 10.1111/hex.12150.

0;Use of artificial neural networks in modeling associations of discriminant factors: towards an intelligent selective breast cancer screening.;Abstract In order to improve the costs/benefits ratio of breast cancer (BC) screenings, the author evaluated the performance of a back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) to predict an outcome (cancer/not cancer) to be used as classificator. Networks were trained on data from familial history of cancer, and sociodemographic, gynecoobstetric and dietary variables. The ANN achieved up to 94.04% of positive predictive value and 97.60% of negative predictive value. Results could operate as guidelines for preselecting women who would be considered as a BC high-risk subpopulation. The procedure--not only based on age factor, but on a multifactorial basis--appears to be a promising method of achieving a more efficient detection of preclinical, asymptomatic BC cases.;Artif Intell Med. 1999 Jul.16(3):299-309.;Ronco AL1.;Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Neural Networks (Computer)*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Use of a mathematical model to evaluate breast cancer screening policy.;Abstract A model of breast cancer screening was developed, in which the processes of tumour origination and growth, detection of tumours at screening, presentation of women with cancers to their GP, and of survival after diagnosis were modelled parametrically. The model was fitted to data from the North-West of the UK, for 413 women who screened positive, and for 761 women who developed interval cancers. Model validation comprised verification that the final model fitted the data adequately, together with the comparison of model predictions with findings by other workers. The mathematical model was used to assess different screening policies, and to ask what if questions. Taking the cost of breast cancer to be the sum of the cost of screening and the cost of PYLL (person years of life lost due to cancer), the optimal screening policy was calculated. The costs of the current policy and of other possible screening policies were found, together with their effects on life lost and on mortality. The tentative conclusion was that if monies can be found to extend the screening programme, for example to carry out one more screen per woman, most benefit would be obtained by reducing the start age of screening by 3 years.;Health Care Manag Sci. 1998 Oct.1(2):103-13.;Baker RD1.;Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Evaluation Studies as Topic,Female,Health Policy*,Humans,Mass Screening/standards*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Program Evaluation,United Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Urban Rural Differences in Breast Cancer in New Zealand.;Abstract Many rural communities have poor access to health services due to a combination of distance from specialist services and a relative shortage of general practitioners. Our aims were to compare the characteristics of urban and rural women with breast cancer in New Zealand, to assess breast cancer-specific and all-cause survival using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model, and to assess whether the impact of rurality is different for Māori and New Zealand (NZ) European women. We found that rural women tended to be older and were more likely to be Māori. Overall there were no differences between urban and rural women with regards their survival. Rural Māori tended to be older, more likely to be diagnosed with metastatic disease and less likely to be screen detected than urban Māori. Rural Māori women had inferior breast cancer-specific survival and all-cause survival at 10 years at 72.1% and 55.8% compared to 77.9% and 64.9% for urban Māori. The study shows that rather than being concerned that more needs to be done for rural women in general it is rural Māori women where we need to make extra efforts to ensure early stage at diagnosis and optimum treatment.;Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2016 Oct 11.13(10). pii: E1000.;Lawrenson R1, Lao C2, Elwood M3, Brown C4, Sarfati D5, Campbell I6.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Female,Humans,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Middle Aged,New Zealand/epidemiology,Population Groups/statistics & numerical data*,Proportional Hazards Models,Rural Population/statistics & numerical data*,Urban Population/statistics & numerical data*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Update of the Swedish Two-County Trial of breast cancer screening: histologic grade-specific and age-specific results.;Abstract The benefit of mammographic screening in reducing mortality from breast cancer is well established. Questions remain with respect to the magnitude of the long-term benefit of modern mammography screening, age specific benefits and the timing of these, and histology specific effects. METHODS: The Swedish Two-County Trial was set up in 1977, with 77,080 women aged 40-74 randomised to invitation to mammographic screening for breast cancer (active study population, ASP) and 55,985 women randomised to no invitation (passive study population, PSP). There is now follow-up for mortality to 31 December 1996, approximately 18 years average follow-up. We investigated the effect of invitation of screening on breast cancer mortality and incidence of advanced tumours by age group (40-49 and 50-74) and histologic type. In addition we estimated progression rates by histologic grade using markov chain models. RESULTS: A significant 29% reduction in breast cancer mortality was observed in association with invitation to screening (relative risk = 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.83), maintaining the effect observed at previous stages of follow-up. Age-specific analyses show a smaller and later mortality benefit in women aged 40-49. This is related to the fact that there is a considerable benefit from early detection in terms of mortality from aggressive, poorly differentiated cancers in women aged 50-74, whereas the major effect in women aged 40-49 is on the less aggressive tumours of good or intermediate differentiation. Among women aged 50-74, the incidence of grade III tumours in the ASP is significantly lower than in the PSP, but this is not the case for women aged 40-49. This is related to the greater prevalence and rapidity of progression with respect to histologic grade, as evidenced by the results of markov chain models and the proportions of grade III tumours by time since last screen. CONCLUSIONS: The substantial and significant mortality benefit of invitation to mammographic screening in women aged 40-74 is maintained at 18 years of follow-up. To achieve a substantial mortality benefit at an early stage in the screening program in women aged under 50 years, an interscreening interval of 12-18 months would be required.;Swiss Surg. 1999.5(5):199-204.;Tabar L1, Vitak B, Chen HH, Prevost TC, Duffy SW.;Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Female,Humans,Mammography,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Population Surveillance,Sweden/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Uncertainty modeling for ontology-based mammography annotation with intelligent BI-RADS scoring.;Abstract This paper presents an ontology-based annotation system and BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) score reasoning with Semantic Web technologies in mammography. The annotation system is based on the Mammography Annotation Ontology (MAO) where the BI-RADS score reasoning works. However, ontologies are based on crisp logic and they cannot handle uncertainty. Consequently, we propose a Bayesian-based approach to model uncertainty in mammography ontology and make reasoning possible using BI-RADS scores with SQWRL (Semantic Query-enhanced Web Rule Language). First, we give general information about our system and present details of mammography annotation ontology, its main concepts and relationships. Then, we express uncertainty in mammography and present approaches to handle uncertainty issues. System is evaluated with a manually annotated dataset DEMS (Dokuz Eylul University Mammography Set) and DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography). We give the result of experimentations in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, precision and uncertainty level measures.;Comput Biol Med. 2013 May.43(4):301-11. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.01.001.

0;Tumour doubling times and the length bias in breast cancer screening programmes.;Abstract Screening for early detection of breast cancer is considered to be an important element of preventive medicine. In this paper, we use numerical simulations to examine the length bias in regular interval screening programmes, by computing the doubling times of breast cancer tumours detected through regular mammographies compared to self-detection. Our analysis shows that doubling times of tumours detected by a regular screening programme are longer than doubling times in the original whole population and considerably longer than those self-detected. Hence regular interval mammographies may be missing a high proportion of fast growing tumours and therefore the benefits of current screening programmes may need to be re-evaluated. We examine the likely size of the length bias for the present UK breast cancer screening programme and perform a sensitivity analysis by varying the screen detection probabilities to reflect future advances in mammographic detection.;Health Care Manag Sci. 2011 Jun.14(2):203-11. doi: 10.1007/s10729-011-9156-9.

0;Tumour development, histology and grade of breast cancers: prognosis and progression.;Abstract Using 1,973 breast tumours from women aged 40-69 participating in the Swedish two-county trial of mammographic screening for breast cancer, we examined the effect of histological type on prognosis and sojourn time (the duration of the preclinical screen-detectable phase) by age. The hypothesis of dedifferentiation, according to which a cancer of mixed malignancy grade drifts towards grade 3 as the more poorly differentiated part of the tumour grows faster than the well-differentiated part, was also assessed. Ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive ductal carcinoma of grade 1, mucinous carcinoma and tubular carcinoma were all associated with good survival. Ductal carcinoma of grade 3 was associated with poor survival. Ductal carcinoma of grade 2, lobular and medullary carcinoma were associated with intermediate survival. These patterns were much the same in women aged 40-49 as in women aged 50-69. In women aged 40-49, sojourn time was estimated at about 2 years regardless of histological type. For women aged 50-69, there was a marked association of sojourn time with histological type, the shortest sojourn time being observed for lobular (2 years) and medullary (1.2 years) carcinoma, and the longest for ductal carcinoma grade 1 (7.7 years) and tubular carcinoma (7.1 years). There was strong evidence of a potential to dedifferentiation. A mover-stayer mixture of Markov chain models estimated that, in women aged 40-54, 91% of ductal tumours have the potential to dedifferentiate and, in women aged 55-69, 38% of ductal tumours have such a potential.;Int J Cancer. 1996 May 16.66(4):413-9.;Tabar L1, Fagerberg G, Chen HH, Duffy SW, Gad A.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/epidemiology,Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast/pathology*,Female,Humans,Mammography,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Prognosis,Survival Analysis,Sweden;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Trichomonas vaginalis and cervical cancer. A prospective study in China.;Abstract The relationship between Trichomonas vaginalis infection and cervical cancer was investigated prospectively in a cohort of 16,797 women aged 25 years or more who were followed from 1974 to 1985 within the framework of a cervical screening program in Jingan, China. Personal interviews were conducted by trained interviewers when the women first entered the screening program. At initial screening, 421 (2.51%) women had a positive cytologic diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection. Ninety-nine incident cases of pathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma were identified from the cohort, with a total of 140,018 person-years of observation. T. vaginalis infection was found to contribute to the risk of cervical cancer, as determined by crude estimates and after adjustment for potential confounding effects. In a multiple proportional hazards model, the relative risk for cervical cancer was 3.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.5 to 7.4) among women with T. vaginalis infection. Furthermore, in the multivariate analysis, increased risk of cervical cancer was associated with the following factors: number of extramarital sexual partners of both the subjects and their spouses, cigarette smoking, and irregular menstruation. Having a large number of negative Pap smears was associated with lower risk. This study suggests that there might be an association between T. vaginalis infection and the risk of cervical cancer, but only 4 to 5% of cervical cancer in Chinese women may be attributable to T. vaginalis infection.;Ann Epidemiol. 1995 Jul.5(4):325-32.;Zhang ZF1, Graham S, Yu SZ, Marshall J, Zielezny M, Chen YX, Sun M, Tang SL, Liao CS, Xu JL, et al.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Animals,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology*,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/etiology,China/epidemiology,Cohort Studies,Confounding Factors (Epidemiology),Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Incidence,Middle Aged,Multivariate Analysis,Prevalence,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Risk Factors,Sexual Partners,Trichomonas Vaginitis/complications,Trichomonas Vaginitis/epidemiology*,Trichomonas vaginalis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/etiology,CA 11535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 ES 06718/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Tracking community sentinel events: breast cancer mortality and neighborhood risk for advanced-stage tumors in Denver.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: The incidence of related sentinel events--breast cancer mortality and neighborhood-specific morbidity for advanced stage at diagnosis--were calculated for women likely to use a community health center in Denver, Colo. METHODS: For the center's service area, neighborhoods (n = 37) were defined by program use. Mortality rates and proportional hazards regression models were estimated for 4189 breast cancer cases recorded between 1979 and 1990. Neighborhood-specific standard morbidity ratios of advanced-stage tumors were based on age-specific rates applied to the entire community. RESULTS: Service area residents were more likely to present with advanced tumors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4. 95% [CI] = 1.2, 1.5). After adjustment, advanced-stage disease and socioeconomic-demographic status, but not race-ethnicity, contributed significantly to survival. Two neighborhoods (6.5% of the population at risk) with standard morbidity ratios of 2.1 (95% CI = 1.3, 3.4) and 1.7 (95% CI = 1.2, 2.5) accounted for 42% of the excess cases of advanced-stage tumors between 1986 and 1990.

1;To expand coverage, or increase frequency: Quantifying the tradeoffs between equity and efficiency facing cervical cancer screening programs in low-resource settings.;Abstract Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with 85% of the disease burden residing in less developed regions. To inform evidence-based decision-making as cervical cancer screening programs are planned, implemented, and scaled in low- and middle-income countries, we used cost and test performance data from the START-UP demonstration project in Uganda and a microsimulation model of HPV infection and cervical carcinogenesis to quantify the health benefits, distributional equity, cost-effectiveness, and financial impact of either (1) improving access to cervical cancer screening or (2) increasing the number of lifetime screening opportunities for women who already have access. We found that when baseline screening coverage was low (i.e., 30%), expanding coverage of screening once in a lifetime to 50% can yield comparable reductions in cancer risk to screening two or three times in a lifetime at 30% coverage, lead to greater reductions in health disparities, and cost 150 international dollars (I$) per year of life saved (YLS). At higher baseline screening coverage levels (i.e., 70%), screening three times in a lifetime yielded greater health benefits than expanding screening once in a lifetime to 90% coverage, and would have a cost-effectiveness ratio (I$590 per YLS) below Uganda's per capita GDP. Given very low baseline coverage at present, we conclude that a policy focus on increasing access for previously unscreened women appears to be more compatible with improving both equity and efficiency than a focus on increasing frequency for a small subset of women.;Int J Cancer. 2017 Mar 15.140(6):1293-1305. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30551.;Campos NG1, Tsu V2, Jeronimo J2, Mvundura M3, Lee K1,4, Kim JJ1.;Adult,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/economics*,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/therapy,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/virology,Computer Simulation*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,DNA, Viral/analysis*,Developing Countries/economics,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Early Detection of Cancer/methods,Female,Health Policy*,Healthcare Disparities,Humans,Life Expectancy,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Models, Economic*,Monte Carlo Method,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Risk Reduction Behavior,Uganda/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/therapy,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,DNA, Viral;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Tipping the balance of benefits and harms to favor screening mammography starting at age 40 years: a comparative modeling study of risk.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Timing of initiation of screening for breast cancer is controversial in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To determine the threshold relative risk (RR) at which the harm-benefit ratio of screening women aged 40 to 49 years equals that of biennial screening for women aged 50 to 74 years. DESIGN: Comparative modeling study. DATA SOURCES: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, and medical literature. TARGET POPULATION: A contemporary cohort of women eligible for routine screening. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Mammography screening starting at age 40 versus 50 years with different screening methods (film, digital) and screening intervals (annual, biennial). OUTCOME MEASURES: BENEFITS: life-years gained, breast cancer deaths averted. harms: false-positive mammography findings. harm-benefit ratios: false-positive findings/life-years gained, false-positive findings/deaths averted. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Screening average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years biennially yields the same false-positive findings/life-years gained as biennial screening with digital mammography starting at age 40 years for women with a 2-fold increased risk above average (median threshold RR, 1.9 [range across models, 1.5 to 4.4]). The threshold RRs are higher for annual screening with digital mammography (median, 4.3 [range, 3.3 to 10]) and when false-positive findings/deaths averted is used as an outcome measure instead of false-positive findings/life-years gained. The harm-benefit ratio for film mammography is more favorable than for digital mammography because film has a lower false-positive rate. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The threshold RRs changed slightly when a more comprehensive measure of harm was used and were relatively insensitive to lower adherence assumptions. LIMITATION: Risk was assumed to influence onset of disease without influencing screening performance. CONCLUSION: Women aged 40 to 49 years with a 2-fold increased risk have similar harm-benefit ratios for biennial screening mammography as average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years. Threshold RRs required for favorable harm-benefit ratios vary by screening method, interval, and outcome measure.

0;Time from Screening Mammography to Biopsy and from Biopsy to Breast Cancer Treatment among Black and White, Women Medicare Beneficiaries Not Participating in a Health Maintenance Organization.;Abstract PURPOSE: There is a breast cancer mortality gap adversely affecting Black women in the United States. This study assessed the relationship between number of days between abnormal mammogram, biopsy, and treatment among Medicare (Part B) beneficiaries ages 65 to 74 and 75 to 84 years, accounting for race and comorbidity. METHODS: A cohort of non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White women residing in the continental United States and receiving no services from a health maintenance organization was randomly selected from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services denominator file. The cohort was followed from 2005 to 2008 using Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims data. The sample included 4,476 women (weighted n = 70,731) with a diagnosis of breast cancer. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to identify predictors of waiting times. FINDINGS: Black women had a mean of 16.7 more days between biopsy and treatment (p < .001) and 15.7 more days from mammogram to treatment (p = .003) than White women. Median duration from abnormal mammogram to treatment exceeded National Quality Measures for Breast Centers medians regardless of race, age, or number of comorbidities (overall 43 days vs. the National Quality Measures for Breast Centers value of 28 days). CONCLUSIONS: Medical care delays may contribute, in part, to the widening breast cancer mortality gap between Black women and White women. Further study, with additional clinical and social information, is needed to broaden scientific understanding of racial determinants and assess the clinical significance of mammogram to treatment times among Medicare beneficiaries.

0;Thermogram breast cancer prediction approach based on Neutrosophic sets and fuzzy c-means algorithm.;Abstract The early detection of breast cancer makes many women survive. In this paper, a CAD system classifying breast cancer thermograms to normal and abnormal is proposed. This approach consists of two main phases: automatic segmentation and classification. For the former phase, an improved segmentation approach based on both Neutrosophic sets (NS) and optimized Fast Fuzzy c-mean (F-FCM) algorithm was proposed. Also, post-segmentation process was suggested to segment breast parenchyma (i.e. ROI) from thermogram images. For the classification, different kernel functions of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used to classify breast parenchyma into normal or abnormal cases. Using benchmark database, the proposed CAD system was evaluated based on precision, recall, and accuracy as well as a comparison with related work. The experimental results showed that our system would be a very promising step toward automatic diagnosis of breast cancer using thermograms as the accuracy reached 100%.;Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2015 Aug.2015:4254-7. doi: 10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319334.;Gaber T, Ismail G, Anter A, Soliman M, Ali M, Semary N, Hassanien AE, Snasel V.;Algorithms,Breast Neoplasms*,Databases, Factual,Female,Fuzzy Logic,Humans,Support Vector Machine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Thermal Signal Analysis for Breast Cancer Risk Verification.;Abstract Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world. Currently, there are no effective methods to prevent this disease. However, early diagnosis increases chances of remission. Breast thermography is an option to be considered in screening strategies. This paper proposes a new dynamic breast thermography analysis technique in order to identify patients at risk for breast cancer. Thermal signals from patients of the Antonio Pedro University Hospital (HUAP), available at the Mastology Database for Research with Infrared Image - DMR-IR were used to validate the study. First, each patient's images are registered. Then, the breast region is divided into subregions of 3x3 pixels and the average temperature from each of these regions is observed in all images of the same patient. Features of the thermal signals of such subregions are calculated. Then, the k-means algorithm is applied over feature vectors building two clusters. Silhouette index, Davies-Bouldin index and Calinski-Harabasz index are applied to evaluate the clustering. The test results showed that the methodology presented in this paper is able to identify patients with breast cancer. Classification techniques have been applied on the index values and 90.90% hit rate has been achieved.;Stud Health Technol Inform. 2015.216:746-50.;Silva LF1, Sequeiros GO1, Santos ML2, Fontes CA2, Muchaluat-Saade DC1, Conci A1.;Evaluation Studies,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Validation Studies,Algorithms*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Female,Humans,Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods*,Infrared Rays,Machine Learning*,Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods*,Reproducibility of Results,Risk Assessment/methods,Sensitivity and Specificity,Thermography/methods*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;The value of improving failures within a cervical cancer screening program: an example from Norway.;Abstract Failures in cervical cancer (CC) screening include nonparticipation, underscreening and loss to follow-up of abnormal results. We estimated the long-term health benefits from and maximum investments in interventions targeted to improving compliance to guidelines while remaining cost-effective. We used a mathematical model empirically calibrated to simulate the natural history of CC in Norway. A baseline scenario reflecting current practice using cytology-based screening was compared to scenarios that target different sources of noncompliance: (i) failure to follow-up women with abnormal results, (ii) screening less frequently than recommended (i.e., underscreening) and (iii) absence of screening. A secondary analysis included human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening as the primary test. Model outcomes included reductions in lifetime cancer risk and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) resulting from improvements with compliance. Compared to the status quo, improving all sources of noncompliance leads to important health gains and produced positive INMBs across a range of developed-country willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. For example, a 2% increase in compliance could reduce lifetime cancer risk by 1-3%, depending on the targeted source of noncompliance and primary screening method. Assuming a WTP threshold of $83,000 per year of life saved and cytology-based screening, interventions that increase follow-up of abnormal results yielded the highest INMB per 2% increase in coverage [$19 ($10-21)]. With HPV-based screening, recruiting nonscreeners resulted in the largest INMB [$23 ($18-32)]. Considerable funds could be allocated toward policies that improve compliance with screening under the current cytology-based program or toward adoption of primary HPV-based screening while remaining cost-effective.;Int J Cancer. 2014 Oct 15.135(8):1931-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28838.

1;The University of Rochester model of breast cancer detection and survival.;Abstract This paper presents a biologically motivated model of breast cancer development and detection allowing for arbitrary screening schedules and the effects of clinical covariates recorded at the time of diagnosis on posttreatment survival. Biologically meaningful parameters of the model are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood from the data on age and tumor size at detection that resulted from two randomized trials known as the Canadian National Breast Screening Studies. When properly calibrated, the model provides a good description of the U.S. national trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality. The model was validated by predicting some quantitative characteristics obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. In particular, the model provides an excellent prediction of the size-specific age-adjusted incidence of invasive breast cancer as a function of calendar time for 1975-1999. Predictive properties of the model are also illustrated with an application to the dynamics of age-specific incidence and stage-specific age-adjusted incidence over 1975-1999.;J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2006.(36):66-78.;Hanin LG1, Miller A, Zorin AV, Yakovlev AY.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Age Factors,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Canada/epidemiology,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/statistics & numerical data,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Models, Statistical*,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Neoplasm Staging,Predictive Value of Tests,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,Survival Rate,N01-PC-67000/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA88177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

0;The risk and survival outcome of subsequent primary colorectal cancer after the first primary colorectal cancer: cases from 1973 to 2012.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors, how the prior tumor location affects the risk of subsequent primary colorectal cancer (SPCRC) and the outcome of those suffering from SPCRC remain unknown. METHODS: CRC cases diagnosed from 1973 to 2012 were screened for SPCRC development using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The relative risk of SPCRC was estimated using the standardized incidence ratio. Survivals were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression model. RESULTS: The overall risk of SPCRC increased by 27% in CRC survivors compared to that of the general population. The risk increased in patients with both prior right colon cancer (RCC) and left colon cancer (LCC), and was concentrated in the first 5 years after the prior diagnosis, and among young patients. Among the 6701 SPCRC patients identified, patients with prior RCC were more likely to be elderly, female, and with more low or undifferentiated disease than those with prior LCC or rectal cancer (ReC). The overall survivals differed by both prior tumor location (P < 0.0001) and age (P < 0.0001), and the difference by tumor location remained significant when adjusted or stratified by any other potential prognostic factor except age. The cancer specific survivals differed by age (P < 0.0001) rather than by prior tumor location (P = 0.455). CONCLUSIONS: The overall risk of SPCRC increased among patients with both prior RCC and LCC, but not among those with ReC. The different survival outcomes in CRC survivors suffering from SPCRC were largely explained by the patient age but not by the prior tumor location.;BMC Cancer. 2017 Nov 22.17(1):783. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3765-8.;Yang J1, Du XL2, Li S1, Wu Y1, Lv M1, Dong D1, Zhang L1, Chen Z1, Wang B1, Wang F1, Shen Y1, Li E1, Yi M3, Yang J4.;Historical Article,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Colorectal Neoplasms/history,Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality,Female,History, 20th Century,History, 21st Century,Humans,Incidence,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Male,Middle Aged,Proportional Hazards Models,SEER Program;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;The Rise in Mortality from Breast Cancer in Young Women: Trend Analysis in Brazil.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze time trends in overall mortality from breast cancer in Brazil, Brazilian regions and States. METHODS: This is an exploratory study, of the time series of deaths from breast cancer contained in the Mortality Information System (SIM), of women living in Brazil, Brazilian regions and States, from 1996 to 2013. For the trend analysis, the polynomial regression model was used, and a significant trend was considered when the estimated model obtained a p value <0.05. RESULTS: There was a tendency of increased mortality from breast cancer in Brazilian women (average increase of 0.18 per year. p <0.001), with regional differences, particularly in the age group 20-49 years (0.07 per year. p <0.001). The age group 50-69 years remained constant but had high average rates (37.14). CONCLUSION: More effective planning is needed to focus on the different scenarios of the Brazilian regions. Screening strategies for the incidence and mortality from breast cancer must also be rethought according to age group in the country.;PLoS One. 2017 Jan 3.12(1):e0168950. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0168950. eCollection 2017.;Rocha-Brischiliari SC1, Oliveira RR2, Andrade L3, Brischiliari A2, Gravena AA1, Carvalho MD4, Pelloso SM5.;Adult,Aged,Brazil,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Data Collection,Female,Humans,Incidence,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Mortality/trends,Regression Analysis,Young Adult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;The relation of breast cancer staging to screening protocol compliance: a computer simulation study.;Abstract A computer model based on relational database techniques was used to analyze the relationship between staging and population compliance to a breast cancer screening protocol. Stage distribution data permitted estimates of compliance to the protocol. This relationship followed the equation y=5.83e-2.44x where y was compliance and x was disease stage. Application of this equation to SEER and NCDB data estimated that the levels of compliance never exceeded 16 percent. Results indicated increasing clinical Stage IV disease as population compliance decreased. As the clinical staging increased there was increased sub-clinical Stage IV disease. With regular screening, simulation suggested that mortality would decrease.;Comput Biol Med. 2005 Feb.35(2):91-101.;Castro F1, Carter KJ, Kessler E, Erickson BA, Kseibi SA.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Clinical Protocols,Computer Simulation*,Female,Humans,Mammography,Mass Screening/standards,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Neoplasm Staging/methods*,Patient Compliance*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;The prognostic significance of race and survival from breast cancer: a model for assessing the reliability of reported survival differences.;Abstract For more than 20 years, black women with breast cancer have been reported to have a lower survival rate than white women with breast cancer. Despite correcting for stage and socioeconomic status, some studies continue to report race-related excess mortality. A reliability scoring system was developed, based primarily on the precision of the staging system used, and the likelihood that the quality of treatment was comparable. Studies that compared the survival of blacks and whites treated for breast cancer from 1968 to 1988 were included in this study. Studies that demonstrated relatively large differences in the 5-year survival between blacks and whites were associated with low reliability scores. Studies that reported little or no difference in 5-year survival rates were associated with relatively high reliability scores. This model and the literature on which it is based suggest that the reported survival differences associated with race can be explained by differences in stage at presentation and by differences in the quality of care received. Efforts directed at early detection and improvements in the quality of care delivered are likely to reduce the excess breast cancer mortality experienced by black women.;J Natl Med Assoc. 1995 Mar.87(3):214-9.;Roach M 3rd1, Alexander M.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Review,African Continental Ancestry Group*,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Female,Humans,Models, Statistical,Prognosis,Reproducibility of Results,Survival Analysis,NS07373/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;The problem of cutoff levels in a screened population: appropriateness of informing screenees about their risk of having prostate carcinoma.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Transrectal prostate biopsy decisions often have been based on absolute cutoff values for total and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The authors decided that it would be more appropriate to develop risk profiles for the individual patient to allow him to decide whether to undergo a prostate biopsy. METHODS: To develop risk profiles, the authors first used multivariate logistic regression analysis to analyze 2054 males who were part of the Tyrol (Austria) PSA Screening Project. Second, artificial neural network (ANN) analyses were performed using data from 3474 males who also were part of the Tyrol PSA Screening Project and who had undergone prostate biopsy. These analyses were compared with standard cutoff levels of specificity for the detection of prostate carcinoma. RESULTS: To the authors' knowledge, this was the first time that multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to decide whether to perform prostate biopsies based on risk profiles rather than on single cutoff levels. For the detection of prostate carcinoma, at sensitivity levels of 90--95%, the ANN was 150--200% more specific than the standard cutoff points. For screened volunteers with total PSA levels below 4 ng/mL, ANN showed a lower cancer predictive ability in comparison with volunteers with total PSA levels above 4 ng/mL. However, the ANN was approximately 150--200% more specific than the standard cutoff levels in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: At high sensitivity levels, ANN increased the specificity for prostate carcinoma detection in a PSA-based screened population. The improvement in specificity between standard cutoff levels and ANN ranged between 150--200% and was not affected by the presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis.

1;The predicted effect of changes in cervical screening practice in the UK: results from a modelling study.;Abstract In 2003, the National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme (NHSCSP) announced that its screening interval would be reduced to 3 years in women aged 25-49 and fixed at 5 years in those aged 50-64, and that women under 25 years will no longer be invited for screening. In order to assess these and possible further changes to cervical screening practice in the UK, we constructed a mathematical model of cervical HPV infection, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cervical cancer, and of UK age-specific screening coverage rates, screening intervals and treatment efficacy. The predicted cumulative lifetime incidence of invasive cervical cancer in the UK is 1.70% in the absence of screening and 0.77% with pre-2003 screening practice. A reduction in lifetime incidence to 0.63% is predicted following the implementation of the 2003 NHSCSP recommendations, which represents a 63% reduction compared to incidence rates in the UK population if it were unscreened. The model suggests that, after the implementation of the 2003 recommendations, increasing the sensitivity of the screening test regime from its current average value of 56 to 90% would further reduce the cumulative lifetime incidence of invasive cervical cancer to 0.46%. Alternatively, extending screening to women aged 65-79 years would further reduce the lifetime incidence to 0.56%. Screening women aged 20-25 years would have minimal impact, with the cumulative lifetime incidence decreasing from 0.63 to 0.61%. In conclusion, the study supports the 2003 recommendations for changes to cervical screening intervals.;Br J Cancer. 2004 Aug 2.91(3):530-6.;Canfell K1, Barnabas R, Patnick J, Beral V.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis*,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/trends*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,National Health Programs*,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Practice Guidelines as Topic*,Sensitivity and Specificity,United Kingdom,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;The potential harms of primary human papillomavirus screening in over-screened women: a microsimulation study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: It is well acknowledged that HPV testing should not be performed at young age and at short intervals. Cytological screening practices have shown that over-screening, i.e., from a younger age and at shorter intervals than recommended, is hard to avoid. We quantified the consequences of a switch to primary HPV screening for over-screened women, taking into account its higher sensitivity but lower specificity than cytology. METHODS: The health effects of using the HPV test instead of cytology as the primary screening method were determined with the MISCAN-Cervix model. We varied the age women start screening and the interval between screens. In the sensitivity analyses, we varied the background risk of cervical cancer, the HPV prevalence, the discount rate, the triage strategy after cytology, and the test characteristics of both cytology and the HPV test. RESULTS: For women screened 5 yearly from age 30, 32 extra deaths per 100,000 simulated women were prevented when switching from primary cytology to primary HPV testing. For annual screening from age 20, such a switch resulted in 6 extra deaths prevented. It was associated with 9,044 more positive primary screens in the former scenario versus 76,480 in the latter. Under all conditions, for women screened annually, switching to HPV screening resulted in a net loss of quality-adjusted life years. CONCLUSION: For over-screened women, the harms associated with a lower test specificity outweigh the life years gained when switching from primary cytology to primary HPV testing. The extent of over-screening should be considered when deciding on inclusion of primary HPV screening in cervical cancer screening guidelines.;Cancer Causes Control. 2016 Apr.27(4):569-81. doi: 10.1007/s10552-016-0732-7.

0;The PAPNET system for quality control of cervical smears: validation and limits.;Abstract The Pap-test may fail to identify false negative cases. Probably only full rescreening assisted by instrument can prevent potential screening and interpretation errors. Therefore, the PAPNET System was used obtain accurate Quality Control (QC) of 3000 conventional cervical smears. Sixteen false negatives were detected with the rescreening assisted by PAPNET. Thirteen positive cases were suspected during evaluation assisted by the PAPNET. two cases were classified as Review for potential inflammatory cellular changes and underwent full optic microscope. In one case both primary screening and the PAPNET did not detect the only abnormal cell cluster located near the coverslip edge, being part of the slide excluded from the scanning process due to focusing problems: only coverslip edge rescreening by optic microscopy allowed the formulation of the correct conclusive diagnosis. In conclusion, the PAPNET System is useful for QC of conventional cervical smears: in fact this instrument allows the identification of false negative cytological errors easily and effectively. Nevertheless, some slide scanning program modifications are needed to detect all abnormal cells present on slide under coverslip.;Anticancer Res. 1997 Nov-Dec.17(6D):4731-4.;Cenci M1, Nagar C, Giovagnoli MR, Vecchione A.;Algorithms,Cervix Uteri/pathology,Endometrium/cytology,Endometrium/pathology,False Negative Reactions,Female,Humans,Inflammation,Neural Networks (Computer),Quality Control,Reference Values,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Vaginal Smears/standards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;The neoplastic transformation potential of mammography X rays and atomic bomb spectrum radiation.;Abstract Considerable controversy currently exists regarding the biological effectiveness of 29 kVp X rays which are used for mammography screening. This issue must be resolved to enable proper evaluation of radiation risks from breast screening. Here a definitive assessment of the biological effectiveness of 29 kVp X rays compared to the quality of radiation to which the atomic bomb survivors were exposed is presented for the first time. The standard radiation sources used were (a) an atomic bomb simulation spectrum and (b) 2.2 MeV electrons from a strontium-90/yttrium-90 (90Sr/90Y) radioactive source. The biological end point used was neoplastic transformation in vitro in CGL1 (HeLa x human fibroblast hybrid) cells. No significant difference was observed for the biological effectiveness of the two high-energy sources for neoplastic transformation. A limiting relative biological effectiveness (RBE(M)) of 4.42 +/- 2.02 was observed for neoplastic transformation by 29 kVp X rays compared to these two sources. This compares with values of 4.67 +/- 3.93 calculated from previously published data and 3.58 +/- 1.77 when the reference radiation was 200 and 220 kVp X rays. This suggests that the risks associated with mammography screening may be approximately five times higher than previously assumed and that the risk-benefit relationship of mammography exposures may need to be re-examined.;Radiat Res. 2004 Aug.162(2):120-7.;Heyes GJ1, Mill AJ.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/radiation effects*,HeLa Cells,Humans,Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced*,Nuclear Warfare*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;The influence of waiting times on cost-effectiveness: a case study of colorectal cancer mass screening.;Abstract When a cost-effectiveness analysis is implemented, the health-care system is usually assumed to adjust smoothly to the proposed new strategy. However, technological innovations in health care may often induce friction in the organization of care supply, implying the congestion of services and subsequent waiting times. Our objective here is to measure how these short run rigidities can challenge cost-effectiveness recommendations favorable to an innovative mass screening test for colorectal cancer. Using Markov modeling, we compare the standard Guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) with an innovative screening test for colorectal cancer, namely the immunological fecal occult blood test (iFOBT). Waiting time can occur between a positive screening test and the subsequent confirmation colonoscopy. Five scenarios are considered for iFOBT: no further waiting time compared with gFOBT, twice as much waiting time for a period of 5 or 10 years, and twice as much waiting time for a period of 5 or 10 years combined with a 25% decrease in participation to confirmation colonoscopies. According to our modeling, compared with gFOBT, iFOBT would approximately double colonoscopy demand. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis enables concluding that the waiting time significantly increases the uncertainty surrounding recommendations favorable to iFOBT if it induces a decrease in the adherence rate for confirmation colonoscopy.;Eur J Health Econ. 2014 Nov.15(8):801-12. doi: 10.1007/s10198-013-0525-9.

1;The influence of disease risk on the optimal time interval between screens for the early detection of cancer: a mathematical approach.;Abstract The intervals between screens for the early detection of diseases such as breast and colon cancer suggested by screening guidelines are typically based on the average population risk of disease. With the emergence of ever more biomarkers for cancer risk prediction and the development of personalized medicine, there is a need for risk-specific screening intervals. The interval between successive screens should be shorter with increasing cancer risk. A risk-dependent optimal interval is ideally derived from a cost-effectiveness analysis using a validated simulation model. However, this is time-consuming and costly. We propose a simplified mathematical approach for the exploratory analysis of the implications of risk level on optimal screening interval. We develop a mathematical model of the optimal screening interval for breast cancer screening. We verified the results by programming the simplified model in the MISCAN-Breast microsimulation model and comparing the results. We validated the results by comparing them with the results of a full, published MISCAN-Breast cost-effectiveness model for a number of different risk levels. The results of both the verification and validation were satisfactory. We conclude that the mathematical approach can indicate the impact of disease risk on the optimal screening interval.;Med Decis Making. 2015 Feb.35(2):183-95. doi: 10.1177/0272989X14528380.

0;The importance of contextual factors and age in association with anxiety and depression in Black breast cancer patients.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Limited research exists on correlates of psychosocial distress in Black breast cancer patients. The goals of the study were to describe the prevalence of distress (anxiety and depression) in Black women with breast cancer and to examine the influence of demographic, clinical, contextual (e.g., self-efficacy, medical mistrust), and process of care factors (e.g., patient satisfaction) on women's level of anxiety and depression. METHODS: Eighty-two Black women diagnosed with invasive non-metastatic breast cancer were interviewed by phone. Collected data included demographic, clinical, contextual, and process of care factors. Bivariate correlations were used to examine relationships between those variables. Multiple linear regressions were used to examine predictors of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: About one-third of the women (32%) met cut-off thresholds for distress. Medical mistrust and positive attitude had significant influences on anxiety levels, whereas age and positive attitude were determinants of levels of depression. Participants with higher medical mistrust reported more anxiety (r = .379. p < .001) and depression (r = .337. p = .002), whereas women with higher self-efficacy reported less anxiety (r = -.401. p < .001) and depression (r = -.427. p < .001). Age was inversely related to both anxiety and depression (r = -.224. r = -.296, respectively. p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings support national recommendations for routine distress screening in the delivery of cancer care particularly in younger Black patients. Interventions targeted to boost self-efficacy or reduce medical mistrust through enhanced patient-provider interactions may decrease psychological distress. Psychosocial needs of younger patients warrant particular attention. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;Psychooncology. 2014 Feb.23(2):143-50. doi: 10.1002/pon.3382.

0;The effectiveness of using standardized patients to improve community physician skills in mammography counseling and clinical breast exam.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Traditional didactic continuing education is relatively ineffective in improving physicians' clinical skills. We hypothesized that a centralized course including small group workshops utilizing standardized patients could improve clinical skills for a reasonable cost. METHODS: We designed a 5-h course aimed at improving physicians' counseling skills (re: screening mammography) and clinical breast exam (CBE) skills. The course included lectures, demonstrations, and small group skills sessions utilizing standardized patients and was offered to 156 typical community-based primary care physicians. Pre- and postcourse evaluation included in-office assessments of physician CBE and counseling performance by standardized patients and a written test of knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: A total of 54.5% of eligible physicians participated. They improved modestly in only one of three areas of counseling skills measured (providing counseling appropriate to the patient's readiness to accept mammography, P = 0.01). The overall CBE score increased substantially from 24.8 to 34.7 (P < 0.0001). Knowledge in all areas measured and confidence in counseling patients also increased. The basic course cost $202 per physician trained. CONCLUSIONS: Most community-based primary care physicians may find small group training and in-office evaluation involving standardized patients acceptable. Such training may be more effective in improving physical exam skills than complex communication skills.;Prev Med. 1999 Oct.29(4):241-8.;Costanza ME1, Luckmann R, Quirk ME, Clemow L, White MJ, Stoddard AM.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Clinical Competence/standards*,Counseling/education*,Education, Medical, Continuing/methods*,Family Practice/education*,Female,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice,Humans,Male,Mammography*,Mass Screening/methods,Palpation*,Patient Simulation*,Program Evaluation,5RO1 CA60130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;The Effect of Changes in Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines on Chlamydia Testing.;Abstract PURPOSE: Many chlamydia infections are identified through screening, which is frequently offered to females concomitantly with cervical cancer screening. Recent cervical cancer screening guidelines recommend screening less frequently and starting later. We sought to evaluate the impact of the May 2012 Ontario, Canada, cervical cancer screening guideline change on Papanicolaou (Pap) and chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) testing and incidence. METHODS: We extracted population-based physician billing claims data to identify Pap and chlamydia tests and public health surveillance data to identify chlamydia cases. We used interrupted time series analysis of quarterly data spanning 2 years before and after the guideline change and fitted segmented linear regression or rational functions to the outcomes using autoregressive integrated moving average models. Outcomes were stratified by sex and age group. RESULTS: Two years after the guideline change, we observed reduced chlamydia testing in females, with the greatest relative reduction (25.5%) among those aged 15 to 19 years. We also observed decreases in reported chlamydia incidence for females aged 15 to 19 years and 20 to 24 years (relative reductions of 16.8% and 14.4%, respectively). Chlamydia incidence remained the same for males, despite increased chlamydia testing. CONCLUSIONS: Recent cervical cancer screening guideline changes in Ontario were associated with reduced chlamydia testing and reported new cases of chlamydia in females. Females aged 15 to 19 years, who are at high risk for chlamydia if sexually active, and who no longer warrant cervical cancer screening, were disproportionately affected. Females should be tested for chlamydia based on risk, regardless of need for Pap testing. � 2017 Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.;Ann Fam Med. 2017 Jul.15(4):329-334. doi: 10.1370/afm.2097.;Naimer MS1,2, Kwong JC1,3,4,5,6, Bhatia D3, Moineddin R7,3,6, Whelan M4, Campitelli MA3, Macdonald L4,6, Lofters A7,3,8,6, Tuite A6, Bogler T7,9, Permaul JA2, McIsaac WJ7,2.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Age Distribution,Chlamydia Infections/diagnosis*,Chlamydia Infections/epidemiology,Chlamydia trachomatis/isolation & purification*,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Humans,Incidence,Interrupted Time Series Analysis,Linear Models,Male,Mass Screening*,Ontario/epidemiology,Papanicolaou Test,Practice Guidelines as Topic,Risk Assessment,Sex Distribution,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Young Adult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;The distribution of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) grade in 4232 women and its impact on overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has rapidly increased over time. The malignant potential of DCIS is dependent on its differentiation grade. METHODS: Our aim is to determine the distribution of different grades of DCIS among women screened in the mass screening programme, and women not screened in the mass screening programme, and to estimate the amount of overdiagnosis by grade of DCIS. We retrospectively included a population-based sample of 4232 women with a diagnosis of DCIS in the years 2007-2009 from the Nationwide network and registry of histopathology and cytopathology in the Netherlands. Excluded were women with concurrent invasive breast cancer, lobular carcinoma in situ and no DCIS, women recently treated for invasive breast cancer, no grade mentioned in the record, inconclusive record on invasion, and prevalent DCIS. The screening status was obtained via the screening organisations. The distribution of grades was incorporated in the well-established and validated microsimulation model MISCAN. RESULTS: Overall, 17.7 % of DCIS were low grade, 31.4 % intermediate grade, and 50.9 % high grade. This distribution did not differ by screening status, but did vary by age. Older women were more likely to have low-grade DCIS than younger women. Overdiagnosis as a proportion of all cancers in women of the screening age was 61 % for low-grade, 57 % for intermediate-grade, 45 % for high-grade DCIS. For women age 50-60 years with a high-grade DCIS this overdiagnosis rate was 21-29 %, compared to 50-66 % in women age 60-75 years with high-grade DCIS. CONCLUSIONS: Amongst the rapidly increasing numbers of DCIS diagnosed each year is a significant number of overdiagnosed cases. Tailoring treatment to the probability of progression is the next step to preventing overtreatment. The basis of this tailoring could be DCIS grade and age.;Breast Cancer Res. 2016 May 10.18(1):47. doi: 10.1186/s13058-016-0705-5.;van Luijt PA1,2, Heijnsdijk EA3,4, Fracheboud J3,4, Overbeek LI5, Broeders MJ4,6,7, Wesseling J8, den Heeten GJ4,6,7,9, de Koning HJ3,4.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/diagnosis,Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/epidemiology*,Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/pathology*,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Humans,Mass Screening,Medical Overuse,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Grading,Netherlands/epidemiology,Population Surveillance*,Registries;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;The detection of breast microcalcifications with medical ultrasound.;Abstract Microcalcifications are small crystals of calcium apatites which form in human tissue through a number of mechanisms. The size, morphology, and distribution of microcalcifications are important indicators in the mammographic screening for and diagnosis of various carcinomas in the breast. Although x-ray mammography is currently the only accepted method for detecting microcalcifications, its efficacy in this regard can be reduced in the presence of dense parenchyma. Current ultrasound scanners do not reliably detect microcalcifications in the size range of clinical interest. The results of theoretical, simulation, and experimental studies focused on the improvement of the ultrasonic visualization of microcalcifications are presented. Methods for estimating the changes in microcalcification detection performance which result from changes in aperture geometry or the presence of an aberrator are presented. An analysis of the relative efficacy of spatial compounding and synthetic receive aperture geometries in the detection of microcalcifications is described. The impact of log compression of the detected image on visualization is discussed. Registered high resolution ultrasound and digital spot mammography images of microcalcifications in excised breast carcinoma tissue and results from the imaging of suspected microcalcifications in vivo are presented.;J Acoust Soc Am. 1997 Jan.101(1):29-39.;Anderson ME1, Soo MS, Bentley RC, Trahey GE.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Breast/pathology*,Calcinosis/diagnosis*,Calcinosis/pathology*,Female,Humans,Models, Anatomic,Ultrasonography, Mammary/methods*,7RO1CA43334/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;The Cost-Effectiveness of Visual Triage of Human Papillomavirus-Positive Women in Three Low- and Middle-Income Countries.;Abstract Background: World Health Organization guidelines support human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone (followed by treatment with cryotherapy) or in conjunction with visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) triage testing. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of VIA triage for HPV-positive women in low-resource settings.Methods: We calibrated mathematical simulation models of HPV infection and cervical cancer to epidemiologic data from India, Nicaragua, and Uganda. Using cost and test performance data from the START-UP demonstration projects, we assumed screening took place either once or three times in a lifetime between ages 30 and 40 years. Strategies included (i) HPV alone, followed by cryotherapy for all eligible HPV-positive women. and (ii) HPV testing with VIA triage for HPV-positive women, followed by cryotherapy for eligible women who were also VIA-positive (HPV-VIA). Model outcomes included lifetime risk of cervical cancer and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs. international dollars/year of life saved).Results: In all three countries, HPV alone was more effective than HPV-VIA. In Nicaragua and Uganda, HPV alone was also less costly than HPV-VIA. ICERs associated with screening three times in a lifetime (HPV alone) were below per capita GDP. In India, both HPV alone and HPV-VIA had ICERs below per capita GDP.Conclusions: VIA triage of HPV-positive women is not likely to be cost-effective in settings with high cervical cancer burden. HPV alone followed by treatment may achieve greater health benefits and value for public health dollars.Impact: This study provides early evidence on the cost-effectiveness of HPV testing followed by VIA triage versus an HPV screen-and-treat strategy.

1;The cost-effectiveness of mammography screening: evidence from a microsimulation model for New Zealand.;Abstract Mammography screening currently represents the only means by which the mortality rate from breast cancer can be modified substantially. A national mammography screening programme is being considered for New Zealand, and pilot programmes were established in two regions (Otago/Southland and Waikato) in 1991 to determine the potential costs and benefits of mammography for New Zealand women. The aim of this paper is to explore the cost-effectiveness of mammography screening in New Zealand relative to no screening, and to examine the marginal change in costs and benefits of altering programme characteristics such as the age of women invited and screening frequency. Cost-effectiveness is measured by the net cost (the costs of screening minus the treatment savings averted by the early detection of cancers) per year of life gained, from the perspective of the public health care sector. A microsimulation computer model, MICROLIFE, was developed to facilitate the estimation of mortality reduction and cost-effectiveness. The results show that, while mammography screening does not 'save money' overall, the cost per year of life saved for a range of policies compares favourably with other New Zealand health services, and is comparable to the results from economic evaluations of mammography screening overseas. Of those regimes considered, screening women 50-64 years of age at 3-yearly intervals appears to be most cost-effective.;Health Policy. 1996 Nov.38(2):101-15.;Szeto KL1, Devlin NJ.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis/statistics & numerical data*,Data Collection,Female,Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data*,Health Services Research,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Mammography/statistics & numerical data,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,New Zealand/epidemiology,Pilot Projects,Women's Health Services/economics*,Women's Health Services/statistics & numerical data;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;The cost-effectiveness of immunochemical tests for colorectal cancer screening.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The optimal immunochemical test to use for generalised mass screening is still under debate in France. AIM: To compare the cost and effectiveness in biennial screening for colorectal cancer of fifteen strategies consisting of the three-stool sample un-rehydrated guaiac faecal occult blood test and three immunochemical tests: Magstream, FOB-Gold and OC-Sensor, at different positivity cut-off levels and stool-sample collection. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare these strategies in a general population of 100,000 individuals aged 50-74 over a 20-year period. RESULTS: Immunochemical tests were efficient strategies compared with guaiac faecal occult blood test. When all 15 strategies were compared with each other, only five of them remained efficient: the one- and two-stool sample Magstream, the one- and two-stool sample FOB-Gold with the 176 ng/mL cut-off, and the two-stool sample OC-Sensor with the 150 ng/mL cut-off. Sensitivity analyses showed that, at an identical price, the one-stool sample OC-Sensor was the most efficient strategy, and outperformed FOB-Gold. CONCLUSION: One-stool immunochemical testing can be considered a promising alternative to the guaiac faecal occult blood test for colorectal cancer mass screening in the general population. Competition between manufacturers should now be introduced to reduce purchase price differences. Copyright © 2013 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1;The cost-effectiveness of cervical screening in Australia: what is the impact of screening at different intervals or over a different age range?;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of altering the currently recommended interval and age range for cervical screening of Australian women. METHODS: The cost and effectiveness estimates of alternative screening strategies were generated using an established decision model. This model incorporated a Markov model (of the natural history of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions) and decision trees which: 'mapped' the various pathways to cervical cancer screening. the follow-up of abnormal Pap test results. and the management of confirmed lesions. The model simulated a hypothetical large cohort of Australian women from age 15 to age 85 and calculated the accumulated costs and life-years under each screening strategy. RESULTS: Our model estimated that moving from the current two-yearly screening strategy to annual screening (over the same age range) would cost $379,300 per additional life-year saved. Moving from the current strategy to three-yearly screening would yield $117,100 of savings per life-year lost (costs and effects both discounted at 5% per year), with a relatively modest (<5%) reduction in the total number of life-years saved by the program. CONCLUSIONS: Although moving to annual screening would save some additional lives, it is not a cost-effective strategy. Consideration should be given to increasing the recommended interval for cervical screening. However, the net value of any such shift to less effective (e.g. less frequent) and less costly screening strategies will require better evidence about the cost-effectiveness of strategies that encourage non-screeners or irregular screeners to have a Pap test more regularly.;Aust N Z J Public Health. 2008 Feb.32(1):43-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1753-6405.2008.00165.x.;Anderson R1, Haas M, Shanahan M.;Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Australia,Cost Savings,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques,Decision Trees,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Program Evaluation,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;The contribution of risk prediction models to early detection of lung cancer.;Abstract Low-dose computed tomography screening is a strategy for early diagnosis of lung cancer. The success of such screening will be dependent upon identifying populations at sufficient risk in order to maximise the benefit-to-harm ratio of the intervention. To facilitate this, the lung cancer risk prediction community has established several risk models with good predictive performance. This review focuses on current progress in risk modelling for lung cancer prediction, with some views on future development.;J Surg Oncol. 2013 Oct.108(5):304-11. doi: 10.1002/jso.23384.

0;The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions in homosexual and bisexual HIV-positive men.;Abstract CONTEXT: Homosexual and bisexual men infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at increased risk for human papillomavirus-related anal neoplasia and anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening HIV-positive homosexual and bisexual men foranal squamous intraepithelial lesions (ASIL) and anal SCC. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis performed from a societal perspective that used reference case recommendations from the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. A state-transition Markov model was developed to calculate lifetime costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy for no screening vs several screening strategies for ASIL and anal SCC using anal Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at different intervals. Values for incidence, progression, and regression of anal neoplasia. efficacy of screening and treatment. natural history of HIV. health-related quality of life. and costs were obtained from the literature. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of homosexual and bisexual HIV-positive men living in the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, quality-adjusted years of life saved, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Screening for ASIL increased quality-adjusted life expectancy at all stages of HIV disease. Screening with anal Pap tests every 2 years, beginning in early HIV disease (CD4 cell count >0.50 x 10(9)/L), resulted in a 2.7-month gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved. Screening with anal Pap tests yearly provided additional benefit at an incremental cost of $16,600 per quality-adjusted life year saved. If screening was not initiated until later in the course of HIV disease (CD4 cell count <0.50 x 10(9)/L), then yearly Pap test screening was preferred due to the greater amount of prevalent anal disease (cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $25,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved compared with no screening). Screening every 6 months provided little additional benefit over that of yearly screening. Results were most sensitive to the rate of progression of ASIL to anal SCC and the effectiveness of treatment of precancerous lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Screening HIV-positive homosexual and bisexual men for ASIL and anal SCC with anal Pap tests offers quality-adjusted life expectancy benefits at a cost comparable with other accepted clinical preventive interventions.;JAMA. 1999 May 19.281(19):1822-9.;Goldie SJ1, Kuntz KM, Weinstein MC, Freedberg KA, Welton ML, Palefsky JM.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Anus Neoplasms/complications,Anus Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Anus Neoplasms/economics,Bisexuality,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/complications,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis*,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Cytodiagnosis/economics*,Disease Progression,HIV Infections/complications*,HIV Infections/economics,HIV Infections/physiopathology,Homosexuality,Humans,Male,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Precancerous Conditions/complications,Precancerous Conditions/diagnosis*,Precancerous Conditions/economics,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Risk Factors,Sensitivity and Specificity,R01 CA054053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,5 M01-RR-00079/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States,R01-CA 54053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U64/CCU114927-01/PHS HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;The clinical breast exam: a skill that should not be abandoned.;Abstract The clinical breast exam (CBE) is an important tool in the care of women. However, the utility of the screening CBE has been called into question. This article discusses the importance of the CBE as a physical diagnosis tool. Recommendations regarding screening with CBE are reviewed, and evidence surrounding breast cancer screening using CBE is briefly summarized. Clinicians should strive to provide high quality CBEs as part of the general clinical exam for women, particularly those who present with breast complaints, and for patients who choose to have CBE screening. In conclusion, there is a role for the CBE in the care of women, and clinicians should be proficient at performing these exams. Simulation teaching technologies are now available at Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) facilities to enable clinicians to improve their CBE skills.;J Gen Intern Med. 2013 May.28(5):719-22. doi: 10.1007/s11606-013-2373-9.;Bryan T1, Snyder E.;Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Clinical Competence*,Early Detection of Cancer/methods,Early Detection of Cancer/standards,Education, Medical/methods,Female,Humans,Mammography,Medical Oncology/education,Patient Simulation,Physical Examination/methods,Physical Examination/standards*,United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;The benefits of cancer screening in kidney transplant recipients: a single-center experience.;Abstract The frequency of malignancy is increasing in kidney transplant recipients. Posttransplant malignancy (PTM) is a major cause of long-term graft survival inhibition. In this study, we evaluated the frequency and prognosis of PTM at our center and examined the efficacy of cancer screening. Between 1972 and 2013, 750 patients were followed-up at our center. Annual physical examinations and screenings were performed to detect PTM. We investigated the detail of two distinctive cancer groups: screening-detected cancers and symptom-detected cancers. Seventy-seven PTM were identified during the follow-up period. The mean age at the initial PTM detection was 43.6 ± 12.8 years. The mean interval from transplantation to cancer diagnosis was 134.5 ± 11.3 months. Among the 77 patients, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) was the most common cancer (19.5%, 15/77), followed by renal cell carcinoma (15.6%, 12/77). Of the cancer cases, 46.8% (36/77) were detected via screening. The most frequently screening-detected cancer was renal cell carcinoma of the native kidney and breast cancer (22.2%, 8/36). However, it was difficult to detect PTLD, urothelial carcinoma, and colorectal cancer via screening. Interestingly, Cox proportional regression analyses revealed nonscreened recipients to be a significant prognostic factor for PTM (P < 0.001). This study is the first to report that appropriate screening tests play a key role in early PTM diagnosis and lead to reduce the mortality rate in kidney transplant recipients. These findings support the provision of long-term appropriate screening for kidney transplant recipients.;Cancer Med. 2016 Feb.5(2):153-8. doi: 10.1002/cam4.568.

0;The accuracy of digital infrared imaging for breast cancer detection in women undergoing breast biopsy.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Mammography has a lower sensitivity for breast cancer detection in younger women and those with dense breasts. Recent improvements in digital infrared breast imaging suggest there may be a role for this technology and we have studied its performance in 100 women prior to breast needle core biopsy (CB). METHODS: All patients were imaged using a digital infrared breast (DIB) scan (Sentinel BreastScan) prior to breast biopsy. Analysis of the infrared scans was performed, blinded to biopsy results, in four different ways: Sentinel screening report, Sentinel artificial intelligence (neural network), expert manual review and NoTouch BreastScan a novel artificial intelligence programme. RESULTS: Of 106 biopsies performed in 100 women, 65 were malignant and 41 were benign. Sensitivity of Sentinel screening (53%) and Sentinel neural network (48%) was low but analysis with NoTouch software (70%) was much closer to expert manual review (78%). Sensitivity (78%) and specificity (75%) using NoTouch BreastScan were higher in women under 50 and the combination of mammography and DIB, with NoTouch interpretation, in this age group resulted in a sensitivity of 89%. CONCLUSION: DIB using NoTouch is an effective adjunctive test for breast cancer detection in women under 70 and appears to be particularly effective in women under 50 where maximal sensitivity (78%) and specificity (75%) were observed. The combined sensitivity of NoTouch BreastScan and mammography in women under 50 was encouraging at 89%, suggesting a potential way forward for a dual imaging approach in this younger age group.;Eur J Surg Oncol. 2010 Jun.36(6):535-40. doi: 10.1016/j.ejso.2010.04.003.

0;Techniques and predictive models to improve prostate cancer detection.;Abstract The use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a screening test remains controversial. There have been several attempts to refine PSA measurements to improve its predictive value. These modifications, including PSA density, PSA kinetics, and the measurement of PSA isoforms, have met with limited success. Therefore, complex statistical and computational models have been created to assess an individual's risk of prostate cancer more accurately. In this review, the authors examined the methods used to modify PSA as well as various predictive models used in prostate cancer detection. They described the mathematical underpinnings of these techniques along with their intrinsic strengths and weaknesses, and they assessed the accuracy of these methods, which have been shown to be better than physicians' judgment at predicting a man's risk of cancer. Without understanding the design and limitations of these methods, they can be applied inappropriately, leading to incorrect conclusions. These models are important components in counseling patients on their risk of prostate cancer and also help in the design of clinical trials by stratifying patients into different risk categories. Thus, it is incumbent on both clinicians and researchers to become familiar with these tools. Cancer 2009.115(13 suppl):3085-99.

0;Teaching strategies to facilitate breast cancer screening by African-American women.;Abstract The objective of this paper is to report on the recent literature concerning coverage of breast cancer epidemiology, the barriers to breast cancer screening, and the strategies to facilitate screening by African-American women. Based on these findings, the author suggests culturally appropriate techniques to be used to promote breast cancer screening in African-American women. Barriers to breast cancer screening in African-American women include emotional reasons, spiritual/religious reasons, fatalism, logistic concerns, lack of knowledge, and lack of follow-up by health-care professionals. Numerous strategies that have been targeted toward African-American women are reported. These include storytelling, witnessing, and testimonies. providing social support and having social support networks. and conducting multifaceted programs that include culturally specific breast health information. Based on the literature reviewed, the author suggests some examples of creative and culturally appropriate techniques that have been implemented with African-American women and that have resulted in positive feedback. These examples include the use of testimonies, photographs, prose, narratives, poetry, and quotations.;J Natl Black Nurses Assoc. 2008 Dec.19(2):42-9.;Gibson LM1.;African Continental Ancestry Group*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Creativity,Female,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice,Humans,Likelihood Functions,Mass Screening/utilization*,Religion,Social Support,Survival Rate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

0;Survival probability and prognostic factors for breast cancer patients in Vietnam.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is becoming a public health problem in Vietnam. The mortality to incidence ratio of the disease was ranked second among the most common cancers in women. This study estimates the survival probability at 1, 3, and 5 years following diagnosis and determines prognostic factors for breast cancer mortality in Vietnam. METHODS: A survival analysis was conducted based on retrospective data from Hue Central Hospital and the Cancer Registry in Ho Chi Minh City. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the survival probability of patients with breast cancer was estimated at 1, 3, and 5 years following diagnosis. The covariates among prognostic factors for survival time were studied using an extended Cox proportion hazards model, including time-dependent predictors. RESULTS: Overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years following diagnosis were 0.94, 0.83 and 0.74 respectively. Marital status, education level, stage at diagnosis, and hormone therapy were prognostic factors for mortality. For the stage at diagnosis, the relation to the risk of death for breast cancer was 1.32 (95% CI, 1.22-1.41). Married women faced a risk of death nearly 1.59 times higher than unmarried women (95% CI, 1.09-2.33). Women with higher levels of education and who received hormone therapy had approximately 10% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.92. 95% CI, 0.89-0.96) and 80% (HR: 0.22. 95% CI, 0.12-0.41) risk reduction of death respectively, compared with those classified as illiterate and those without hormone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year survival probability of breast cancer was lower in Vietnam than in countries with similar distributions of the stage at diagnosis. Screening programs and related support policies should be developed to increase the life expectancy of women with breast cancer in Vietnam.;Glob Health Action. 2013 Jan 17.6:1-9. doi: 10.3402/gha.v6i0.18860.;Lan NH1, Laohasiriwong W, Stewart JF.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Estrogen Replacement Therapy,Female,Humans,Incidence,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models,Socioeconomic Factors,Vietnam/epidemiology,R24 HD050924/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Survival of patients with lung cancer, Yazd, Iran.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Lung carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Although the 5-year survival rate nearly tripled from 5-15% over the last 25 years, the estimated number of deaths still exceeds 1.3 million annually. The overall 5-year survival of lung cancer is only 10% in Europe and 15% in the United States. The aim of the current study was to determine the long-term survival and the effect of certain prognostic factors on survival of patients with lung cancer in Yazd city, Iran. METHODS: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, we retrospectively reviewed hospital records and follow-up data of 148 patients with histological proven lung cancer using the cancer data registered between 1998 and 2005 in the pathology department of Shahid Sadoughi educational hospital, Yazd, Iran. Data were extracted from patient documents that included sex, age, clinical manifestations, histopathological report of the tumor and type of treatment given. RESULTS: Overall survival time in all patients was 8.5 months after diagnosis and there was no significant difference in survival according to sex (p=0.958). Histological analysis revealed that squamous cell carcinoma was the most common histologic type (35%). Kaplan-Meier statistical methods estimated the average survival time for SCC to be better (22.6 months) in comparison with the other types of histology (all of them below 10 months). There was a trend towards significance between type of histology and duration of survival (p=0.08). CONCLUSION: It is reasonable to expect that early lung cancer detection, and appropriated treatment, may improve surgical morbidity and mortality. Low survival of lung cancer in our center patients show our shortages in screening programs for early diagnosis. Designing studies with larger sample size that take some other variables like staging of patients is now necessary.;Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012.13(9):4387-91.;Zahir ST1, Mirtalebi M.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adenocarcinoma/mortality*,Adenocarcinoma/pathology,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/mortality*,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Iran/epidemiology,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Lung Neoplasms/mortality*,Lung Neoplasms/pathology,Male,Middle Aged,Proportional Hazards Models,Retrospective Studies,Survival Rate,Time Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Survival of first and second primary breast cancer.;Abstract BACKGROUND: A second primary tumor (SPT) in the breast is the most common one seen in clinical practice. There are conflicting reports regarding the incidence and survival of patients with SPT in the breast. METHODS: To elucidate this, data on 139,932 patients with primary breast cancer, reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program between 1973 and 1986, were analyzed. Of these, 3431 patients had a contralateral metachronous breast cancer (interval, > 6 months). RESULTS: Survival from the date of diagnosis of the metachronous breast tumors was compared with that of patients with single breast tumors, controlling for age at diagnosis, stage, race, and treatment. In the multivariate analysis, age and stage at diagnosis of first and second tumors were the only variables that significantly influenced survival. The survival of patients with localized SPT was similar to that of patients with a localized single breast tumor. Patients with regionally advanced SPT lived for a shorter time than did corresponding patients with only one tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with single breast cancer were at increased risk of having a SPT in the breast. As a result, efforts for early detection by physical examination and mammography of survivors of single breast cancer are advocated because the survival of patients with a localized SPT in the breast is as good as that of those with a single localized tumor.;Cancer. 1993 Jan 1.71(1):172-6.;Robinson E1, Rennert G, Rennert HS, Neugut AI.;Age Factors,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Female,Humans,Incidence,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/mortality*,Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/pathology,Proportional Hazards Models,Survival Analysis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Survival impact index and ultrahigh-dimensional model-free screening with survival outcomes.;Abstract Motivated by ultrahigh-dimensional biomarkers screening studies, we propose a model-free screening approach tailored to censored lifetime outcomes. Our proposal is built upon the introduction of a new measure, survival impact index (SII). By its design, SII sensibly captures the overall influence of a covariate on the outcome distribution, and can be estimated with familiar nonparametric procedures that do not require smoothing and are readily adaptable to handle lifetime outcomes under various censoring and truncation mechanisms. We provide large sample distributional results that facilitate the inference on SII in classical multivariate settings. More importantly, we investigate SII as an effective screener for ultrahigh-dimensional data, not relying on rigid regression model assumptions for real applications. We establish the sure screening property of the proposed SII-based screener. Extensive numerical studies are carried out to assess the performance of our method compared with other existing screening methods. A lung cancer microarray data is analyzed to demonstrate the practical utility of our proposals.;Biometrics. 2016 Dec.72(4):1145-1154. doi: 10.1111/biom.12499.

0;Survival analysis of breast cancer patients using Cox and frailty models.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model is the most widely used model for survival analysis. When there are unobserved/unmeasured individuals factor, then the results of the Cox proportional hazard model may not be reliable. The purpose of this study was to compare the results of CPH and frailty models in breast cancer (BC) patients. METHODS: A historical cohort study was carried out using medical records gathered from the Fars Province Cancer Registry. The dataset consisted of 769 women having BC referred to Shiraz Namazi Hospital, south of Iran. These patients had been followed for 6 years. After selecting the most important prognostic risk factors on survival, CPH and gamma-frailty Cox models were used to estimate the effects of the risk factors. RESULTS: The results of CPH model showed that, tumor characteristics and number of involved lymph nodes increase the mortality hazard of BC(P<0.05). In addition, the frailty model showed that there is at least a latent factor in the model (P=0.005). CONCLUSION: Both of the frailty and CPH model emphasis that the early detection of BC improves survival in BC patients.;J Res Health Sci. 2012 Dec 13.12(2):127-30.;Faradmal J1, Talebi A, Rezaianzadeh A, Mahjub H.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Cohort Studies,Early Detection of Cancer/mortality,Female,Humans,Iran/epidemiology,Lymph Nodes/pathology,Lymphatic Metastasis,Middle Aged,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Factors,Survival Analysis,Young Adult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy + support vector machine: a new noninvasive method for prostate cancer screening?;Abstract Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies of the older males worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to improve the survival of patients. Recently, we developed a new method for prostate cancer screening: by measuring the serum surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of prostate cancer patients and normal subjects, combining with classification algorithms of support vector machines, the measured surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy spectra are successfully classified with accuracy of 98.1%. Although the practical application faces several difficulties, we believe that this label-free serum surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy analysis technique combined with support vector machine diagnostic algorithms will become a powerful tool for noninvasive prostate cancer screening in the future.;Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2015 Jan.15(1):5-7. doi: 10.1586/14737140.2015.992419.;Li S1, Guo Z, Liu Z.;Editorial,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/methods,Predictive Value of Tests,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Spectrum Analysis, Raman/methods*,Support Vector Machine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Support vector machine based diagnostic system for breast cancer using swarm intelligence.;Abstract Breast cancer is becoming a leading cause of death among women in the whole world, meanwhile, it is confirmed that the early detection and accurate diagnosis of this disease can ensure a long survival of the patients. In this paper, a swarm intelligence technique based support vector machine classifier (PSO_SVM) is proposed for breast cancer diagnosis. In the proposed PSO-SVM, the issue of model selection and feature selection in SVM is simultaneously solved under particle swarm (PSO optimization) framework. A weighted function is adopted to design the objective function of PSO, which takes into account the average accuracy rates of SVM (ACC), the number of support vectors (SVs) and the selected features simultaneously. Furthermore, time varying acceleration coefficients (TVAC) and inertia weight (TVIW) are employed to efficiently control the local and global search in PSO algorithm. The effectiveness of PSO-SVM has been rigorously evaluated against the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD), which is commonly used among researchers who use machine learning methods for breast cancer diagnosis. The proposed system is compared with the grid search method with feature selection by F-score. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only obtains much more appropriate model parameters and discriminative feature subset, but also needs smaller set of SVs for training, giving high predictive accuracy. In addition, Compared to the existing methods in previous studies, the proposed system can also be regarded as a promising success with the excellent classification accuracy of 99.3% via 10-fold cross validation (CV) analysis. Moreover, a combination of five informative features is identified, which might provide important insights to the nature of the breast cancer disease and give an important clue for the physicians to take a closer attention. We believe the promising result can ensure that the physicians make very accurate diagnostic decision in clinical breast cancer diagnosis.;J Med Syst. 2012 Aug.36(4):2505-19. doi: 10.1007/s10916-011-9723-0.

0;Summary measures of agreement and association between many raters' ordinal classifications.;Abstract PURPOSE: Interpretation of screening tests such as mammograms usually require a radiologist's subjective visual assessment of images, often resulting in substantial discrepancies between radiologists' classifications of subjects' test results. In clinical screening studies to assess the strength of agreement between experts, multiple raters are often recruited to assess subjects' test results using an ordinal classification scale. However, using traditional measures of agreement in some studies is challenging because of the presence of many raters, the use of an ordinal classification scale, and unbalanced data. METHODS: We assess and compare the performances of existing measures of agreement and association as well as a newly developed model-based measure of agreement to three large-scale clinical screening studies involving many raters' ordinal classifications. We also conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the key properties of the summary measures. RESULTS: The assessment of agreement and association varied according to the choice of summary measure. Some measures were influenced by the underlying prevalence of disease and raters' marginal distributions and/or were limited in use to balanced data sets where every rater classifies every subject. Our simulation study indicated that popular measures of agreement and association are prone to underlying disease prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Model-based measures provide a flexible approach for calculating agreement and association and are robust to missing and unbalanced data as well as the underlying disease prevalence.

0;Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in general medical illnesses.;Abstract BACKGROUND: This study examines the association between the presence of a general medical illness and suicidality in a representative sample of US young adults. METHODS: Between 1988 and 1994, 7589 individuals aged 17 to 39 years were administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule as part of a national probability survey. The survey collected information about lifetime suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, a checklist of common general medical conditions, and data on major depression, alcohol use, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Whereas 16.3% of respondents described suicidal ideation at some point in their lives, 25.2% of individuals with a general medical condition, and 35.0% of those with 2 or more medical illnesses reported life-time suicidal ideation. Similarly, whereas 5.5% of respondents had made a suicide attempt, 8.9% of those with a general medical illness and 16.2% of those with 2 or more medical conditions had attempted suicide. In models controlling for major depression, depressive symptoms, alcohol use, and demographic characteristics, presence of a general medical condition predicted a 1.3 times increase in likelihood of suicidal ideation. more specifically, pulmonary diseases (asthma, bronchitis) were associated with a two-thirds increase in the odds of lifetime suicidal ideation. Cancer and asthma were each associated with a more than 4-fold increase in the likelihood of a suicide attempt. CONCLUSIONS: A significant association was found between medical conditions and suicidality that persisted after adjusting for depressive illness and alcohol use. The findings support the need to screen for suicidality in general medical settings, over and above use of general depression instruments.;Arch Intern Med. 2000 May 22.160(10):1522-6.;Druss B1, Pincus H.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adolescent,Adult,Chronic Disease/psychology*,Female,Humans,Likelihood Functions,Male,Personality Assessment,Risk,Suicide/psychology*,Suicide/statistics & numerical data,Suicide, Attempted/psychology*,Suicide, Attempted/statistics & numerical data,United States,K08-MH01566-01A1/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with increased risk for cancer mortality in adult Taiwanese-a 10 years population-based cohort.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The association between subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and cancer mortality is seldom discussed. METHODS: A total of 115,746 participants without thyroid disease history, aged 20 and above, were recruited from four nationwide health screening centers in Taiwan from 1998 to 1999. SCH was defined as a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 5.0-19.96 mIU/L with normal total thyroxine concentrations. Euthyroidism was defined as a serum TSH level of 0.47-4.9 mIU/L. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) of death from cancer for adults with SCH during a 10-year follow-up period. RESULTS: Among 115,746 adults, 1,841 had SCH (1.6%) and 113,905 (98.4%) had euthyroidism. There were 1,532 cancer deaths during the 1,034,082 person-years follow-up period. Adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, alcohol drinking, betel nut chewing, physical activity, income, and education level, the RRs (95% confidence interval) of cancer deaths among subjects with SCH versus euthyroid subjects were 1.51 (1.06 to 2.15). Cancer site analysis revealed a significant increased risk of bone, skin and breast cancer among SCH subjects (RR 2.79, (1.01, 7.70)). The risks of total cancer deaths were more prominent in the aged (RR 1.71, (1.02 to 2.87)), in females (RR 1.69 (1.08 to 2.65)), and in heavy smokers (RR 2.24, (1.19 to 4.21)). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with SCH had a significantly increased risk for cancer mortality among adult Taiwanese. This is the first report to demonstrate the association between SCH and cancer mortality.;PLoS One. 2015 Apr 1.10(4):e0122955. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0122955. eCollection 2015.;Tseng FY1, Lin WY2, Li CI3, Li TC4, Lin CC5, Huang KC6.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Asymptomatic Diseases/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Hypothyroidism/complications,Hypothyroidism/mortality*,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Male,Middle Aged,Neoplasms/etiology,Neoplasms/mortality*,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Factors,Taiwan/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Structured additive regression modeling of age of menarche and menopause in a breast cancer screening program.;Abstract Breast cancer risk is believed to be associated with several reproductive factors, such as early menarche and late menopause. This study is based on the registries of the first time a woman enters the screening program, and presents a spatio-temporal analysis of the variables age of menarche and age of menopause along with other reproductive and socioeconomic factors. The database was provided by the Portuguese Cancer League (LPCC), a private nonprofit organization dealing with multiple issues related to oncology of which the Breast Cancer Screening Program is one of its main activities. The registry consists of 259,652 records of women who entered the screening program for the first time between 1990 and 2007 (45-69-year age group). Structured Additive Regression (STAR) models were used to explore spatial and temporal correlations with a wide range of covariates. These models are flexible enough to deal with a variety of complex datasets, allowing us to reveal possible relationships among the variables considered in this study. The analysis shows that early menarche occurs in younger women and in municipalities located in the interior of central Portugal. Women living in inland municipalities register later ages for menopause, and those born in central Portugal after 1933 show a decreasing trend in the age of menopause. Younger ages of menarche and late menopause are observed in municipalities with a higher purchasing power index. The analysis performed in this study portrays the time evolution of the age of menarche and age of menopause and their spatial characterization, adding to the identification of factors that could be of the utmost importance in future breast cancer incidence research.;Biom J. 2014 May.56(3):416-27. doi: 10.1002/bimj.201200260.

1;Strategic Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for Improving National Cancer Screening Uptake in Cervical Cancer: A Focus on Regional Inequality in South Korea.;Abstract PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a cost effectiveness analysis of strategies designed to improve national cervical cancer screening rates, along with a distributional cost effectiveness analysis that considers regional disparities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov cohort simulation model, with quality adjusted life years as the unit of effectiveness. The strategies considered were current (biennial Papanicolaou smear cytology of females aged 20 or above), strong screening recommendation by mail to target regions (effect, 12% increase in screening uptake. cost, 1,000 Korean won per person), regular universal screening recommendation by mail (effect, 6% increase in screening uptake. cost, 500 Korean won per person), and strong universal screening recommendation by mail (effect, 12% increase in screening uptake. cost, 1,000 Korean won per person). Distributional cost effectiveness analysis was conducted by calculating the cost effectiveness of strategies using the Atkinson incremental cost effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: All strategies were under the threshold value, which was set as the Korean gross domestic product of $25,990. In particular, the 'strong screening recommendation to target regions' strategy was found to be the most cost effective (incremental cost effectiveness ratio, 7,361,145 Korean won). This was also true when societal inequality aversion increased in the distributional cost effectiveness analysis. CONCLUSION: The 'strong screening recommendation to target regions' strategy was the most cost effective approach, even when adjusting for inequality. As efficiency and equity are objectives concurrently sought in healthcare, these findings imply a need to develop appropriate economic evaluation methodologies to assess healthcare policies.;Cancer Res Treat. 2018 Jan.50(1):212-221. doi: 10.4143/crt.2016.525.

0;Statistical models for longitudinal biomarkers of disease onset.;Abstract We consider the analysis of serial biomarkers to screen and monitor individuals in a given population for onset of a specific disease of interest. The biomarker readings are subject to error. We survey some of the existing literature and concentrate on two recently proposed models. The first is a fully Bayesian hierarchical structure for a mixed effects segmented regression model. Posterior estimates of the changepoint (onset time) distribution are obtained by Gibbs sampling. The second is a hidden changepoint model in which the onset time distribution is estimated by maximum likelihood using the EM algorithm. Both methods lead to a dynamic index that represents a strength of evidence that onset has occurred by the current time in an individual subject. The methods are applied to some large data sets concerning prostate specific antigen (PSA) as a serial marker for prostate cancer. Rules based on the indices are compared to standard diagnostic criteria through the use of ROC curves adapted for longitudinal data.;Stat Med. 2000 Feb 29.19(4):617-37.;Slate EH1, Turnbull BW.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Algorithms,Bayes Theorem,Biomarkers*,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Male,Models, Statistical*,Prostate-Specific Antigen,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis,ROC Curve,Biomarkers,Prostate-Specific Antigen,R01 CA61120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA66218/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA79080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Standardized rates of recurrent outcomes.;Abstract Longitudinal studies are often concerned with estimating the rate of an event that may recur. Examples are nonmelanoma skin cancer rates, screening rates for breast cancer using mammography and hospital admission rates. We propose simple estimators for directly and indirectly standardized summary rates and relative rates of recurrent events and their variances. We also develop an estimator of the excess rate in an area if the rate in another area applied. For non-recurrent events, the estimators are identical to the usual standardized summary rates. The estimators are independent of the underlying distribution of the event of interest and allow for unequal follow-up times and event rate heterogeneity among individuals. The method is not computationally intensive and does not require specialized software. We illustrate the application of the method in a retrospective cohort study of hospital utilization patterns of Medicare enrollees in Boston and New Haven over a three and a half year period.;Stat Med. 1994 Sep 15.13(17):1781-91.;Stukel TA1, Glynn RJ, Fisher ES, Sharp SM, Lu-Yao G, Wennberg JE.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Boston,Cohort Studies,Connecticut,Data Interpretation, Statistical*,Episode of Care*,Forecasting,Health Expenditures/statistics & numerical data,Hospitalization/economics,Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Medicare,Models, Statistical,Patient Admission/statistics & numerical data,Recurrence,Regression Analysis,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,United States,CA52192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,CA57494/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,HS05745/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Stage-specific cancer incidence: an artificially mixed multinomial logit model.;Abstract Early detection of prostate cancer using the prostate-specific antigen test led to a sharp spike in the incidence of the disease accompanied by an equally sharp improvement in patient prognoses as evaluated at the point of advanced diagnosis. Observed outcomes represent age at diagnosis and stage, a categorical prognostic variable combining the actual stage and the grade of tumor. The picture is summarized by the stage-specific cancer incidence that represents a joint survival-multinomial response regressed on factors affecting the unobserved history of the disease before diagnosis (mixture). Fitting the complex joint mixed model to large population data is a challenge. We develop a stable and structured MLE approach to the problem allowing for the estimates to be obtained iteratively. Factorization of the likelihood achieved by our method allows us to work with only a fraction of the model dimension at a time. The approach is based on generalized self-consistency and the quasi-EM algorithm used to handle the mixed multinomial part of the response through Poisson likelihood. The model provides a causal link between the screening policy in the population and the stage-specific incidence.;Stat Med. 2009 Jul 10.28(15):2054-76. doi: 10.1002/sim.3615.;Chefo S1, Tsodikov A.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Humans,Likelihood Functions,Male,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Neoplasm Staging/statistics & numerical data,Prostatic Neoplasms/classification*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology*,SEER Program/statistics & numerical data,United States/epidemiology,U01 CA097414/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA097414-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA97414/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Stage distribution at first and repeat examinations in breast cancer screening.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To investigate observed stage distributions at first and repeat screenings. To compare the observed outcomes with expected values based on simulation modelling, varying the assumptions about the natural history of the disease. METHODS: An overview is made of observed data on stage distribution at first and repeat screenings and the difference between those distributions is summarised in a Gini coefficient. Four possible explanations for the observations are considered, two of these are worked out as Miscan simulation models, and the outcomes are compared with observations. RESULTS: Often the reported stage distributions at repeat screenings are not or only slightly more favourable than at first screenings and, in the ones that are more favourable, the difference is relatively small. If, in the Miscan model, it is assumed that there is no correlation between the duration of preclinical breast cancer in consecutive tumour size categories and that there is a strong influence of latent cancers, it is not possible to reproduce the observed outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The two modelled explanations are not sufficient. Decreasing sensitivity seems an unlikely explanation for the discrepancy in many screening programmes. The possibility that the observations may be explained because false reassurance has been given should be seriously considered and investigated.;J Med Screen. 1999.6(3):132-8.;Boer R1, de Koning H, van Oortmarssen G, Warmerdam P, van der Maas P.;Meta-Analysis,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Computer Simulation,Confidence Intervals,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Neoplasm Staging/statistics & numerical data,Sensitivity and Specificity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Spatio-temporal imaging of the hemoglobin in the compressed breast with diffuse optical tomography.;Abstract We develop algorithms for imaging the time-varying optical absorption within the breast given diffuse optical tomographic data collected over a time span that is long compared to the dynamics of the medium. Multispectral measurements allow for the determination of the time-varying total hemoglobin concentration and of oxygen saturation. To facilitate the image reconstruction, we decompose the hemodynamics in time into a linear combination of spatio-temporal basis functions, the coefficients of which are estimated using all of the data simultaneously, making use of a Newton-based nonlinear optimization algorithm. The solution of the extremely large least-squares problem which arises in computing the Newton update is obtained iteratively using the LSQR algorithm. A Laplacian spatial regularization operator is applied, and, in addition, we make use of temporal regularization which tends to encourage similarity between the images of the spatio-temporal coefficients. Results are shown for an extensive simulation, in which we are able to image and quantify localized changes in both total hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation. Finally, a breast compression study has been performed for a normal breast cancer screening subject, using an instrument which allows for highly accurate co-registration of multispectral diffuse optical measurements with an x-ray tomosynthesis image of the breast. We are able to quantify the global return of blood to the breast following compression, and, in addition, localized changes are observed which correspond to the glandular region of the breast.;Phys Med Biol. 2007 Jun 21.52(12):3619-41.

1;Sojourn time and lead time projection in lung cancer screening.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: We investigate screening sensitivity, transition probability and sojourn time in lung cancer screening for male heavy smokers using the Mayo Lung Project data. We also estimate the lead time distribution, its property, and the projected effect of taking regular chest X-rays for lung cancer detection. METHODS: We apply the statistical method developed by Wu et al. [1] using the Mayo Lung Project (MLP) data, to make Bayesian inference for the screening test sensitivity, the age-dependent transition probability from disease-free to preclinical state, and the sojourn time distribution, for male heavy smokers in a periodic screening program. We then apply the statistical method developed by Wu et al. [2] using the Bayesian posterior samples from the MLP data to make inference for the lead time, the time of diagnosis advanced by screening for male heavy smokers. The lead time is distributed as a mixture of a point mass at zero and a piecewise continuous distribution, which corresponds to the probability of no-early-detection, and the probability distribution of the early diagnosis time. We present estimates of these two measures for male heavy smokers by simulations. RESULTS: The posterior sensitivity is almost symmetric, with posterior mean 0.89, and posterior median 0.91. the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval is (0.72, 0.98). The posterior mean sojourn time is 2.24 years, with a posterior median of 2.20 years for male heavy smokers. The 95% HPD interval for the mean sojourn time is (1.57, 3.35) years. The age-dependent transition probability is not a monotone function of age. it has a single maximum at age 68. The mean lead time increases as the screening time interval decreases. The standard error of the lead time also increases as the screening time interval decreases. CONCLUSION: Although the mean sojourn time for male heavy smokers is longer than expected, the predictive estimation of the lead time is much shorter. This may provide policy makers important information on the effectiveness of the chest X-rays and sputum cytology in lung cancer early detection.

0;Social support buffers the effect of self-esteem on quality of life of early-stage cervical cancer survivors in Taiwan.;Abstract PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of self-esteem and social support on quality of life (QoL) in stage I and II cervical cancer survivors. METHOD: The sample consisted of 110 participants who had been diagnosed with stage I-II cervical cancer and had completed their treatment 5 years or more before data collection. Each participant completed four structured questionnaires: a demographic-disease survey, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, and hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 60.74 � 10.69 years. Better QoL was significantly associated with younger age, higher self-esteem, and stronger social support. in addition, social support buffered the effect of self-esteem on global QoL. Together, five variables (age, time since treatment, self-esteem, social support, and the interaction term of self-esteem and social support) explained 36% of the variance in global QoL, with self-esteem being the strongest predictor. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study advance current knowledge of QoL in cervical cancer survivors by demonstrating that survivors with low self-esteem and social support tend to have lower QoL than those with low self-esteem but high social support. Health professionals should help survivors seek support and provide appropriate strategies to expand their social networks and enhance their self-esteem to improve their global QoL after cervical cancer.

0;Social support and non-participation in breast cancer screening: a Danish cohort study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Social support may have an impact on screening participation. We studied the association between social support in 2006, defined as frequencies of contacts, instrumental support and emotional support and participation in breast cancer screening in 2008-09. METHODS: This population-based cohort study included 4512 women who had participated in a Health Survey in 2006 and who also were in the target group for the first round of organized breast cancer screening in the Central Denmark region in 2008-09. RESULTS: Women with infrequent contacts with friends and family in 2006 were more likely not to participate in screening in 2008-09 [prevalence ratio (PR) 1.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.26, P-value < 0.001 and PR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.20, P-value < 0.001, respectively] as were women who reported not to have someone to look after her home if she was away for some time and women who reported usually not or never having someone to turn to with personal concerns (PR 1.97, 95% CI 1.53-2.54, P-value < 0.001 and PR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14-1.77, P-value = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Low social support, indicated by items in each social support attribute, was associated with non-participation in breast cancer screening in 2008-09. Targeted social interventions may, therefore, have an impact on future screening behaviour, which calls for further research. © The Author 2015.

0;Simulation models in population breast cancer screening: A systematic review.;Abstract The aim of this review was to critically evaluate published simulation models for breast cancer screening of the general population and provide a direction for future modeling. A systematic literature search was performed to identify simulation models with more than one application. A framework for qualitative assessment which incorporated model type. input parameters. modeling approach, transparency of input data sources/assumptions, sensitivity analyses and risk of bias. validation, and outcomes was developed. Predicted mortality reduction (MR) and cost-effectiveness (CE) were compared to estimates from meta-analyses of randomized control trials (RCTs) and acceptability thresholds. Seven original simulation models were distinguished, all sharing common input parameters. The modeling approach was based on tumor progression (except one model) with internal and cross validation of the resulting models, but without any external validation. Differences in lead times for invasive or non-invasive tumors, and the option for cancers not to progress were not explicitly modeled. The models tended to overestimate the MR (11-24%) due to screening as compared to optimal RCTs 10% (95% CI - 2-21%) MR. Only recently, potential harms due to regular breast cancer screening were reported. Most scenarios resulted in acceptable cost-effectiveness estimates given current thresholds. The selected models have been repeatedly applied in various settings to inform decision making and the critical analysis revealed high risk of bias in their outcomes. Given the importance of the models, there is a need for externally validated models which use systematical evidence for input data to allow for more critical evaluation of breast cancer screening.;Breast. 2015 Aug.24(4):354-63. doi: 10.1016/j.breast.2015.03.013.

1;Simulation modeling of change to breast cancer detection age eligibility recommendations in Ontario, 2002-2021.;Abstract PURPOSE: The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the development and use of a decision support tool based on simulation modeling of breast cancer screening to evaluate the implications for the provision of health services and the economic impact of extending routine radiographic screening for breast cancer to women in the 40-49 age group between 2002 and 2021. METHODS: The main method was computer simulation with a Markov model that used published estimates of population size by age group, breast cancer prevalence and incidence, screening program participation rate, sensitivity and specificity of the screening test and diagnostic test, stage transition probabilities, directed diagnosis rates and costs. FINDINGS: The model predicted that changes to age eligibility requirements would result in the detection of an additional 6610 women with breast cancer in Ontario requiring treatment, at an additional cost of 795 Canadian per case. These costs include those related to screening, diagnosis and initial treatment and apply to the 20-year period.

1;Significant improvement in breast cancer survival through population-based mammography screening.;Abstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of population-based mammography screening on survival. A total of 176 908 screening examinations were performed in 36 000 women aged 40-74 during the years 1987-1997. Screen-detected and interval primary invasive breast cancers (n=685, screened) were more often smaller (P<0.0001), localised (P<0.0001) and histologically better differentiated (grade I vs II-III, P<0.0001) than pre-screening cancers and cancers detected after the defined interval from the last screening (n=184, clinical). Survival was far better in the screened group than in the clinical group (P<0.0001, HR 2.55. CI 95% 1.77-3.67). Cox's multivariate analysis revealed axillary lymph node negativity (P<0.0001), histological grade I (P=0.0005) and size less than or equal to 20mm (P=0.0118) as explanations of the beneficial effect of screening. A new observation we recorded was that screening had a beneficial effect even in women whose cancer had already spread into the axillary lymph nodes.;Breast. 2003 Oct.12(5):308-13.;Klemi PJ1, Parvinen I, Pylkkänen L, Kauhava L, Immonen-Räihä P, Räsänen O, Helenius H.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Confidence Intervals,Female,Finland,Humans,Mammography/utilization*,Mass Screening/standards*,Mass Screening/trends,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Population Surveillance,Predictive Value of Tests,Probability,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Assessment,Survival Analysis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Should Never-Smokers at Increased Risk for Lung Cancer Be Screened?;Abstract INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer in never-smokers ranks among the 10 most common causes of death due to cancer worldwide and in the United States. However, it is unknown whether never-smokers at elevated risk for developing lung cancer may benefit from lung cancer screening. METHODS: The MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis (MISCAN)-Lung microsimulation model was used to assess the effects of lung cancer screening for simulated cohorts of never-smokers at different levels of relative risk (RR) for lung cancer compared with never-smokers at average risk. The benefits and harms of screening were estimated for each cohort and compared with those of a cohort of ever-smokers eligible for lung cancer screening according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria. RESULTS: The relative lung cancer mortality reduction in never-smokers was higher than the USPSTF eligible cohort (37% compared with 32%). However, the number of life-years gained per lung cancer death averted was lower (10.4 compared with 11.9) and the proportion of overdiagnosed cancers was higher (9.6% compared with 8.4%) for never-smokers compared with the USPSTF eligible cohort, as never-smokers are diagnosed at a later age. The estimated number of screens per lung cancer death averted ranged from 6162 for never-smokers at average risk to 151 for never-smokers with an RR of 35 compared with 353 for the USPSTF eligible cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Never-smokers with RRs of 15 to 35 have similar to better trade-offs between benefits and harms compared with ever-smokers recommended for lung cancer screening by the USPSTF guidelines. For most never-smokers, lung cancer screening is not beneficial.;J Thorac Oncol. 2015 Sep.10(9):1285-1291. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0000000000000593.;Ten Haaf K1, de Koning HJ2.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/etiology*,Lung Neoplasms/mortality,Male,Mass Screening,Risk Assessment,U01 CA152956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,5U01CA152956-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Shifting breast cancer trends in the United States.;Abstract PURPOSE: United States breast cancer incidence rates declined during the years 1999 to 2003, and then reached a plateau. These recent trends are impressive and may indicate an end to decades of increasing incidence. METHODS: To put emerging incidence trends into a broader context, we examined age incidence patterns (frequency and rates) during five decades. We used age density plots, two-component mixture models, and age-period-cohort (APC) models to analyze changes in the United States breast cancer population over time. RESULTS: The National Cancer Institute's Connecticut Historical Database and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program collected 600,000+ in situ and invasive female breast cancers during the years 1950 to 2003. Before widespread screening mammography in the early 1980s, breast cancer age-at-onset distributions were bimodal, with dominant peak frequency (or mode) near age 50 years and smaller mode near age 70 years. With widespread screening mammography, bimodal age distributions shifted to predominant older ages at diagnosis. From 2000 to 2003, the bimodal age distribution returned to dominant younger ages at onset, similar to patterns before mammography screening. APC models confirmed statistically significant calendar-period (screening) effects before and after 1983 to 1987. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer in the general United States population has a bimodal age at onset distribution, with modal ages near 50 and 70 years. Amid a background of previously increasing and recently decreasing incidence rates, breast cancer populations shifted from younger to older ages at diagnosis, and then back again. These dynamic fluctuations between early-onset and late-onset breast cancer types probably reflect a complex interaction between age-related biologic, risk factor, and screening phenomena.;J Clin Oncol. 2007 Sep 1.25(25):3923-9.

1;Setting the target for a better cervical screening test: characteristics of a cost-effective test for cervical neoplasia screening.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential effects on costs and outcomes of changes in sensitivity and specificity with new screening methods for cervical cancer. METHODS: Using a Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer, we estimated the effects of sensitivity, specificity, and screening frequency on cost-effectiveness. Our estimates of conventional Papanicolaou test sensitivity of 51% and specificity of 97% were obtained from a meta-analysis. We estimated the effect of reducing false-negative rates from 40-90% and increasing false-positive rates by up to 20%, independently and jointly. We varied the marginal cost of improving sensitivity from $0 to $15. RESULTS: When specificity was held constant, increasing sensitivity of the Papanicolaou test increased life expectancy and costs. When sensitivity was held constant, decreasing specificity of the Papanicolaou test increased costs, an effect that was more dramatic at more frequent intervals. Decreased specificity had a substantial effect on cost-effectiveness estimates of improved Papanicolaou test sensitivity. Most of those effects are related to the cost of evaluation and treatment of low-grade lesions. CONCLUSION: Policies or technologies that increased sensitivity of cervical cytologic screening increased overall costs, even if the cost of the technology was identical to that of conventional Papanicolaou smears. These effects appear to be caused by relatively high prevalence of low-grade lesions and are magnified at frequent screening intervals. Efficient cervical cancer screening requires methods with greater ability to detect lesions that are most likely to become cancerous.;Obstet Gynecol. 2000 Nov.96(5 Pt 1):645-52.;Myers ER1, McCrory DC, Subramanian S, McCall N, Nanda K, Datta S, Matchar DB.;Meta-Analysis,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/standards*,Middle Aged,Papanicolaou Test*,Sensitivity and Specificity,United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology*,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Vaginal Smears/standards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Screening mammography & breast cancer mortality: meta-analysis of quasi-experimental studies.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The magnitude of the benefit associated with screening has been debated. We present a meta-analysis of quasi-experimental studies on the effects of mammography screening. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase for articles published through January 31, 2013. Studies were included if they reported: 1) a population-wide breast cancer screening program using mammography with 5+ years of data post-implementation. 2) a comparison group with equal access to therapies. and 3) breast cancer mortality. Studies excluded were: RCTs, case-control, or simulation studies. We defined quasi-experimental as studies that compared either geographical, historical or birth cohorts with a screening program to an equivalent cohort without a screening program. Meta-analyses were conducted in Stata using the metan command, random effects. Meta-analyses were conducted separately for ages screened: under 50, 50 to 69 and over 70 and weighted by population and person-years. RESULTS: Among 4,903 published papers that were retrieved, 19 studies matched eligibility criteria. Birth cohort studies reported a significant benefit for women screened <age 50, but not for women screened ages 50-69. Significant reductions in breast cancer mortality were observed in historical comparisons. For geographical comparisons, there was a significant 20% reduction in mortality for women <age 50 and a significant 21-22% reduction for women ages 50-69. Studies that tested the interaction of geographical and historical comparisons produced a pooled, significant 13-17% reduction in incident breast cancer mortality for women ages 50-69, but the effects in most individual studies were non-significant. All studies of women ages 70+ were non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Mammography screening may have modest effects on cancer mortality between the ages of 50 and 69 and non-significant effects for women older than age 70. Results are consistent with meta-analyses of RCTs. Effects on total mortality could not be assessed because of the limited number of studies.;PLoS One. 2014 Jun 2.9(6):e98105. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0098105. eCollection 2014.;Irvin VL1, Kaplan RM1.;Meta-Analysis,Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Confidence Intervals,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Geography,Humans,Mammography*,Middle Aged,Publication Bias,Risk Factors,Intramural NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Screening for Colorectal Cancer With Fecal Immunochemical Testing With and Without Postpolypectomy Surveillance Colonoscopy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Population-based screening to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) death is effective, but the effectiveness of postpolypectomy surveillance is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the additional benefit in terms of cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance in a screening setting. DESIGN: Microsimulation using the ASCCA (Adenoma and Serrated pathway to Colorectal CAncer) model. DATA SOURCES: Dutch CRC screening program and published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Asymptomatic persons aged 55 to 75 years without a prior CRC diagnosis. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Health care payer. INTERVENTION: Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening with colonoscopy surveillance performed according to the Dutch guideline was simulated. The comparator was no screening or surveillance. FIT screening without colonoscopy surveillance and the effect of extending surveillance intervals were also evaluated. OUTCOME MEASURES: CRC burden, colonoscopy demand, life-years, and costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: FIT screening without surveillance reduced CRC mortality by 50.4% compared with no screening or surveillance. Adding surveillance to FIT screening reduced mortality by an additional 1.7% to 52.1% but increased lifetime colonoscopy demand by 62% (from 335 to 543 colonoscopies per 1000 persons) at an additional cost of €68 000, for an increase of 0.9 life-year. Extending the surveillance intervals to 5 years reduced CRC mortality by 51.8% and increased colonoscopy demand by 42.7% compared with FIT screening without surveillance. In an incremental analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for screening plus surveillance exceeded the Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of €36 602 per life-year gained. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: When using a parameter set representing low colorectal lesion prevalence or when colonoscopy costs were halved or colorectal lesion incidence was doubled, screening plus surveillance became cost-effective compared with screening without surveillance. LIMITATION: Limited data on FIT performance and background CRC risk in the surveillance population. CONCLUSION: Adding surveillance to FIT screening is not cost-effective based on the Dutch ICER threshold and substantially increases colonoscopy demand.

1;Screening for Cervical Cancer in Primary Care: A Decision Analysis for the US Preventive Services Task Force.;Abstract IMPORTANCE: Evidence on the relative benefits and harms of primary high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing is needed to inform guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To inform the US Preventive Services Task Force by modeling the benefits and harms of various cervical cancer screening strategies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Microsimulation model of a hypothetical cohort of women initiating screening at age 21 years. EXPOSURES: Screening with cytology, hrHPV testing, and cytology and hrHPV cotesting, varying age to switch from cytology to hrHPV testing or cotesting (25, 27, 30 years), rescreening interval (3, 5 years), and triage options for hrHPV-positive results (16/18 genotype, cytology testing). Current guidelines-based screening strategies comprised cytology alone every 3 years starting at age 21 years, with or without a switch to cytology and hrHPV cotesting every 5 years from ages 30 to 65 years. Complete adherence for all 19 strategies was assumed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime number of tests, colposcopies, disease detection, false-positive results, cancer cases and deaths, life-years, and efficiency ratios expressing the trade-off of harms (ie, colposcopies, tests) vs benefits (life-years gained, cancer cases averted). Efficient strategies were those that yielded more benefit and less harm than another strategy or a lower harm to benefit ratio than a strategy with less harms. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, all modeled cervical cancer screening strategies were estimated to result in substantial reductions in cancer cases and deaths and gains in life-years. The effectiveness of screening across the different strategies was estimated to be similar, with primary hrHPV-based and alternative cotesting strategies having slightly higher effectiveness and greater harms than current guidelines-based cytology testing. For example, cervical cancer deaths associated with the guidelines-based strategies ranged from 0.30 to 0.76 deaths per 1000 women, whereas new strategies involving primary hrHPV testing or cotesting were associated with fewer cervical cancer deaths, ranging from 0.23 to 0.29 deaths per 1000 women. In all analyses, primary hrHPV testing strategies occurring at 5-year intervals were efficient. For example, 5-year primary hrHPV testing (cytology triage) based on switching from cytology to hrHPV screening at ages 30 years, 27 years, and 25 years had ratios per life-year gained of 73, 143, and 195 colposcopies, respectively. In contrast, strategies involving 3-year hrHPV testing had much higher ratios, ranging from 2188 to 3822 colposcopies per life-year gained. In most analyses, strategies involving cotesting were not efficient. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this microsimulation modeling study, it was estimated that primary hrHPV screening may represent a reasonable balance of harms and benefits when performed every 5 years. Switching from cytology to hrHPV testing at age 30 years yielded the most efficient harm to benefit ratio when using colposcopy as a proxy for harms.;JAMA. 2018 Aug 21.320(7):706-714. doi: 10.1001/jama.2017.19872.;Kim JJ1, Burger EA1,2, Regan C1, Sy S1.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Advisory Committees,Aged,Cervix Uteri/pathology,Cervix Uteri/virology,Colposcopy/utilization,Decision Support Techniques*,Early Detection of Cancer*/methods,Female,Humans,Incidence,Life Expectancy,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Practice Guidelines as Topic*,Process Assessment (Health Care),United States,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Vaginal Smears*,Young Adult,U01 CA199334/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Screening as an application of decision theory.;Abstract We develop a decision-theoretical approach to setting the threshold for a screening procedure that declares each examined subject as a positive or a negative. It is fundamentally different from maximising the Youden index. The method incorporates the consequences of the two kinds of bad decisions (false positives and false negatives) by means of a set of plausible loss functions elicited from a subject-matter expert or committee. We present details for several classes of loss functions and within-group distributions of the outcomes. We outline extensions related to mixture distributions and compositions of loss functions. We illustrate the method on simulated examples and apply it to real datasets.;Stat Med. 2013 Feb 28.32(5):849-63. doi: 10.1002/sim.5554.

0;Rotary scanning equalization radiography: an efficient geometry for equalization mammography.;Abstract The detection of cancer in the radiographically dense breast is problematic, since the breast will produce a range of exposure that exceeds the useful dynamic range of high contrast film-screen combinations. It has been shown previously that mammographic scanning equalization radiography (MSER) can be used to overcome the latitude limitations of film-screen mammography. However, the tube loading of MSER is orders of magnitude greater than conventional mammography. A new rotary geometry for equalization radiography is proposed, in which the image receptor is exposed by repeated scans of a modulated slot beam, oriented at a variety of scanning angles with respect to the object. The superposition of the exposure from appropriately modulated, rotated slot beams produces an entrance exposure that will effectively equalize the film exposure. The principle advantages of this geometry is its simplicity and reduced tube loading. To determine the effectiveness and feasibility of RSER the effect of conventional, MSER, and RSER have been numerically simulated on the appearance of clinical mammograms, the relative heat loading, and the fraction of the breast imaged with high contrast are calculated. It is found that RSER produces images that are free of artefacts, and exhibit a similar degree of equalization, as found in MSER images. RSER accomplishes this with only four scanning angles, and a beam that is approximately 4 cm wide. The resulting tube loading is only three times greater than that found in conventional imaging. Numerical simulations indicate that RSER is a simple, feasible means of overcoming the latitude limitations of film-screen mammography.;Med Phys. 1994 Oct.21(10):1523-33.;Sabol JM1, Tam KK, Plewes DB.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Computer Simulation,Female,Humans,Mammography*,Models, Theoretical*,Radiography/methods*,X-Rays;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Risk of invasive cancer among women visually screened and colposcopy triaged by trained nurses in rural South India.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term risk of cervical cancer among women screened by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and to evaluate the benefit of additional colposcopy triage in rural south India. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted among 31 343 women who had undergone VIA at Dindigul district, India between January 1, 2000, and August 5, 2003, as part of a randomized screening trial. Women with positive VIA test results were offered colposcopy triage by trained nurses. Cervical cancer incidence data during follow-up (January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2012) were obtained from a regional cancer registry. RESULTS: Among 3021 screen-positive women free of cancer at baseline, 2974 women underwent colposcopy. colposcopic abnormalities suggestive of precancerous lesions were detected among 2792 of these women (93.9%). Compared with the women with negative VIA screening results, the hazard ratio (HR) of cervical cancer during follow-up among the VIA-positive women without colposcopic abnormalities was 6.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-27.1). The risk was similar among VIA-positive women with colposcopic abnormalities but without histological confirmation (HR5.2. 95% CI, 1.9-14.6). CONCLUSION: The high risk of cancer among women without colposcopic abnormalities who tested positive by VIA suggested that screening without triage is potentially effective.

1;Risk of cervical cancer associated with extending the interval between cervical-cancer screenings.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Although contemporary guidelines suggest that the intervals between Papanicolaou tests can be extended to three years among low-risk women with previous negative tests, the excess risk of cervical cancer associated with less frequent than annual screening is uncertain. METHODS: We determined the prevalence of biopsy-proven cervical neoplasia among 938,576 women younger than 65 years of age, stratified according to the number of previous consecutive negative Papanicolaou tests. Using a Markov model that estimates the rate at which dysplasia will progress to cancer, we estimated the risk of cancer within three years after one or more negative Papanicolaou tests, as well as the number of additional Papanicolaou tests and colposcopic examinations that would be required to avert one case of cancer given a particular interval between screenings. RESULTS: Among 31,728 women 30 to 64 years of age who had had three or more consecutive negative tests, the prevalence of biopsy-proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 was 0.028 percent and the prevalence of grade 3 neoplasia was 0.019 percent. none of the women had invasive cervical cancer. According to our model, the estimated risk of cancer with annual Papanicolaou tests for three years was 2 in 100,000 among women 30 to 44 years of age, 1 in 100,000 among women 45 to 59 years of age, and 1 in 100,000 among women 60 to 64 years of age. these risks would be 5 in 100,000, 2 in 100,000, and 1 in 100,000, respectively, if screening were performed once three years after the last negative test. To avert one additional case of cancer by screening 100,000 women annually for three years rather than once three years after the last negative test, an average of 69,665 additional Papanicolaou tests and 3861 colposcopic examinations would be needed in women 30 to 44 years of age and an average of 209,324 additional Papanicolaou tests and 11,502 colposcopic examinations in women 45 to 59 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with annual screening for three years, screening performed once three years after the last negative test in women 30 to 64 years of age who have had three or more consecutive negative Papanicolaou tests is associated with an average excess risk of cervical cancer of approximately 3 in 100,000.

0;Risk factors for breast cancer associated with mammographic features in Singaporean chinese women.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Mammographic density has been found to be a strong risk factor for breast cancer and to be associated with age, body weight, parity, and menopausal status. Most studies to date have been carried out in Western populations. The purpose of the study described here was to determine in a cross-sectional study in a Singaporean Chinese population the demographic, menstrual, reproductive, and anthropometric factors that are associated with quantitative variations in age-adjusted percentage mammographic densities and to examine the association of these factors with the dense and nondense areas of the mammogram. METHOD: We used mammograms and questionnaire data collected from subjects in the Singapore Breast Screening Project. Women ages 45 to 69 years participated and 84% of those screened were Chinese. Mammograms were digitized and percentage density was measured and analyzed in relation to the questionnaire data. RESULTS: Percentage mammographic density was associated with several risk factors for breast cancer, most of them also associated, in opposite directions, with the dense and nondense components of the image. Percentage density was associated with age and weight (both negatively), height and age at first birth (both positively), and number of births and postmenopausal status (both negatively). Percentage density was weakly associated with a previous breast biopsy but was not associated with age at menarche or menopause, with use of hormones, or with a family history of breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Percentage mammographic density in Singaporean Chinese women has similar associations with risk factors for breast cancer to those seen in Caucasians.;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2004 Nov.13(11 Pt 1):1751-8.;Heng D1, Gao F, Jong R, Fishell E, Yaffe M, Martin L, Li T, Stone J, Sun L, Hopper J, Boyd NF.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast/pathology*,Breast Neoplasms/etiology*,Cross-Sectional Studies,Estrogen Replacement Therapy,Female,Hormone Replacement Therapy,Humans,Linear Models,Mammography*,Menopause,Middle Aged,Reproductive History,Risk Factors,Singapore,Surveys and Questionnaires;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Retrospective study of reasons for improved survival in patients with breast cancer in east Anglia: earlier diagnosis or better treatment.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To investigate the recent fall in mortality from breast cancer in England and Wales, and to determine the relative contributions of improvements in treatment and earlier detection of tumours. DESIGN: Retrospective study of all women with breast cancer registered by the East Anglian cancer registry and diagnosed between 1982 and 1989. SUBJECTS: 3965 patients diagnosed 1982-5 compared with 4665 patients diagnosed 1986-9, in three age groups 0-49, 50-64, > or = 65 years, with information on stage at diagnosis and survival. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three year relative survival rates by time period, age group, and stage. relative hazard ratios for each time period and age group derived from Cox's proportional hazards model, adjusted for single year of age and stage. RESULTS: Survival improved in the later time period, although there was little stage specific improvement. The proportion of early stage tumours increased especially in the 50-64 year age group, and adjustment for stage accounted for over half of the improvement in survival in women aged under 65 years. CONCLUSION: Over half of the drop in mortality in women aged under 65 years seems to be attributable to earlier detection of tumours, which has been observed since the mid-1980s. This could have resulted from an increase in breast awareness predating the start of the breast screening programme.;BMJ. 1997 Feb 15.314(7079):472-5.;Stockton D1, Davies T, Day N, McCann J.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Child,Child, Preschool,England/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Proportional Hazards Models,Quality of Health Care,Retrospective Studies,Survival Analysis,Survival Rate,Wales/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

0;Relationship between physician supply and breast cancer survival: a geographic approach.;Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, accounting for nearly 30% of all female cancers. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in women in the US. During the last two decades, the benefits of early detection, early intervention, and postoperative treatment have resulted in decreased breast cancer mortality in the US general population. However, the distribution of breast cancer mortality varies among geographic regions of the US. The reasons for this variation remain largely unknown. We choose to look for a possible association between the numbers of physicians in each city within the State of Florida and breast cancer survival among women aged 40+ residing in that particular city. Using Cox Proportionate Hazard Modeling, we found a direct association between the number of physicians practicing in a particular city and breast cancer survival in that particular city (P=0.0153), while controlling for other known risk factors affecting survival. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report an association between physician supply and cancer survival within defined geographic areas. This association shows as physician density consistently dropped in a defined geographic area so did time of survival among women with breast cancer.;J Community Health. 2008 Aug.33(4):179-82. doi: 10.1007/s10900-008-9090-z.;Fleisher JM1, Lou JQ, Farrell M.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Female,Florida,Geography/statistics & numerical data*,Health Manpower/statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Middle Aged,Physicians/statistics & numerical data*,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Factors,SEER Program,Socioeconomic Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Relationship among age, race, medical funding, and cervical cancer survival.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of age, race, and medical funding on cervical cancer survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study design was a retrospective chart review of cervical cancer patients. Charts were abstracted for demographic characteristics, Pap smear history, clinical presentation, treatment, and survival. Descriptive studies, Spearman correlation, and Cox's proportional hazards regression model were performed. RESULTS: One hundred-twenty-five cervical cancer patients were included. Mean age at diagnosis was 46.1 +/- 13.2 years, and median survival time from cervical cancer was 31 months. 11.2% of the study population was aged greater than 65 years. 63.4% were African American. and 44.6% had no medical funding. Diagnosis at age of at least 65 years was significantly correlated with suboptimal cervical cancer screening pattern (r = 0.36, p = .0003). Women aged at least 65 years old had a 3.39 time increased hazard of death compared to younger patients (p = .02. OR, 3.39. 95% CI, 1.20-9.56) after adjusting for advanced stage of disease and treatment modality. There was no significant association between medical funding or race on cervical cancer screening pattern, stage at diagnosis, or survival. CONCLUSION: Age at diagnosis (> or = 65 years), but not medical funding or race, was correlated with suboptimal cervical cancer screening pattern and poor survival.;J Natl Med Assoc. 2010 Mar.102(3):199-205.;Federico C1, Alleyn J, Dola C, Tafti S, Galandak J, Jacob C, Bhuiyan A, Cheng J.;Age Factors,Educational Status,Employment/statistics & numerical data,Female,Humans,Insurance Coverage/statistics & numerical data*,Louisiana/epidemiology,Middle Aged,Proportional Hazards Models,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,Survival Analysis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/ethnology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Relation between number of siblings and adult mortality and stroke risk: 25 year follow up of men in the Collaborative study.;Abstract STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between number of siblings, mortality risk, and stroke risk. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: 27 workplaces in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 5765 employed men aged 35-64 from a variety of different workplaces, screened between 1970 and 1973. MAIN RESULTS: There were strong relationships between number of siblings and socioeconomic variables and also with adult behavioural measures. Men with greater numbers of siblings had an increased risk of dying of all causes, coronary heart disease, lung cancer, stomach cancer, and respiratory disease over a 25 year follow up period. Adjustment for risk factors could explain these associations, excepting stomach cancer mortality. With the definition of stroke as either a hospital admission for stroke or death from stroke, there was a strong relation between number of siblings and haemorrhagic stroke, but not ischaemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Number of siblings is strongly related to mortality risk, but as it is also related to many risk factors, adjustment for these can generally explain the relation with mortality. The exceptions are stomach cancer mortality and haemorrhagic stroke, which are known to be related to deprivation in childhood, and, in the case of stomach cancer to childhood infection.;J Epidemiol Community Health. 2003 May.57(5):385-91.;Hart CL1, Davey Smith G.;Multicenter Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Coronary Disease/mortality,Female,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/mortality,Male,Middle Aged,Mortality*,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Respiratory Tract Diseases/mortality,Risk Factors,Scotland/epidemiology,Siblings*,Social Class,Socioeconomic Factors,Stomach Neoplasms/mortality,Stroke/epidemiology*,Stroke/etiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Regional trends in breast cancer incidence and mortality in Denmark prior to mammographic screening.;Abstract To provide a basis for the evaluation of mammographic screening programmes in Denmark, a study was undertaken of the regional differences in breast cancer incidence and mortality. All 16 regions were followed for the 20 year period, 1970-89, before the start of the first population-based mammographic screening programme in the Copenhagen municipality in 1991. Multiplicative Poisson models were used for the analysis. In general, the incidence increased during this period from 55 to 70 [per 100,000 standardised world standard population (WSP)], and the analysis shows this to be most pronounced among women below age 60. The mortality was more stable, changing only from 24 to 28 (per 100,000 standardised WSP), but a significant increase occurred in the late 1980s. The study showed regional differences in both incidence and mortality of breast cancer in Denmark. Both the incidence and the mortality varied between the regions, with maximum differences of 22%. The analysis showed no variation in the time trends in the different regions, and thus indicates that the use of a regional comparison group would be a valid basis for evaluation of the Copenhagen programme. Our study, however, underlies the difficulties inherent in the evaluation of screening programmes without internal control groups.;Br J Cancer. 1994 Jul.70(1):133-7.;Andreasen AH1, Andersen KW, Madsen M, Mouridsen H, Olesen KP, Lynge E.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Child,Child, Preschool,Denmark/epidemiology,Epidemiology/trends,Female,Humans,Incidence,Infant,Likelihood Functions,Mammography,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Poisson Distribution,Program Evaluation/methods,Residence Characteristics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Reduction of Poisson noise in measured time-resolved data for time-domain diffuse optical tomography.;Abstract A method to reduce noise for time-domain diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is proposed. Poisson noise which contaminates time-resolved photon counting data is reduced by use of maximum a posteriori estimation. The noise-free data are modeled as a Markov random process, and the measured time-resolved data are assumed as Poisson distributed random variables. The posterior probability of the occurrence of the noise-free data is formulated. By maximizing the probability, the noise-free data are estimated, and the Poisson noise is reduced as a result. The performances of the Poisson noise reduction are demonstrated in some experiments of the image reconstruction of time-domain DOT. In simulations, the proposed method reduces the relative error between the noise-free and noisy data to about one thirtieth, and the reconstructed DOT image was smoothed by the proposed noise reduction. The variance of the reconstructed absorption coefficients decreased by 22% in a phantom experiment. The quality of DOT, which can be applied to breast cancer screening etc., is improved by the proposed noise reduction.;Med Biol Eng Comput. 2012 Jan.50(1):69-78. doi: 10.1007/s11517-011-0774-7.

0;Reduced likelihood of cancer screening among women in urban areas and with low socio-economic status: a multilevel analysis in Japan.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To elucidate socio-economic predictors of participation in cancer screening in Japanese women, paying attention to regional variations. METHODS: In a nationally representative sample of women aged 40--64 years (n=15,224) in Japan, the relationships of self-reported attendance at screening for stomach, colon, uterine and breast cancers with individual characteristics (marital status, occupation and household income) and regional variables (living in a metropolitan area or not, and per capita income) were examined using multilevel analysis. RESULTS: The participation rate ranged from 21.6% for colon cancer to 32.5% for uterine cancer. Being married, employed and having a higher household income were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of cancer screening for all types of cancer: the adjusted odds ratio in the lowest income quintile ranged from 0.45 for uterine cancer to 0.53 for colon cancer compared with the highest income quintile. There was significant regional variance, and living in a metropolitan area and per capita income were associated with a reduced likelihood of cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: Women with lower socio-economic status and living in urban areas are less likely to participate in cancer screening in Japan. Cancer screening should be encouraged in urban areas, taking account of the socio-economic inequalities.;Public Health. 2005 Oct.119(10):875-84.;Fukuda Y1, Nakamura K, Takano T.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Data Collection,Female,Humans,Japan,Likelihood Functions,Mass Screening/utilization*,Middle Aged,Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Social Class*,Urban Population;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Recalibration of the Gail model for predicting invasive breast cancer risk in Spanish women: a population-based cohort study.;Abstract The Gail model for predicting the absolute risk of invasive breast cancer has been validated extensively in US populations, but its performance in the international setting remains uncertain. We evaluated the predictive accuracy of the Gail model in 54,649 Spanish women aged 45-68 years who were free of breast cancer at the 1996-1998 baseline mammographic examination in the population-based Navarre Breast Cancer Screening Program. Incident cases of invasive breast cancer and competing deaths were ascertained until the end of 2005 (average follow-up of 7.7 years) through linkage with population-based cancer and mortality registries. The Gail model was tested for calibration and discrimination in its original form and after recalibration to the lower breast cancer incidence and risk factor prevalence in the study cohort, and compared through cross-validation with a Navarre model fully developed from this cohort. The original Gail model overpredicted significantly the 835 cases of invasive breast cancer observed in the cohort (ratio of expected to observed cases 1.46, 95 % CI 1.36-1.56). The recalibrated Gail model was well calibrated overall (expected-to-observed ratio 1.00, 95 % CI 0.94-1.07), but it tended to underestimate risk for women in low-risk quintiles and to overestimate risk in high-risk quintiles (P = 0.01). The Navarre model showed good cross-validated calibration overall (expected-to-observed ratio 0.98, 95 % CI 0.92-1.05) and in different cohort subsets. The Navarre and Gail models had modest cross-validated discrimination indexes of 0.542 (95 % CI 0.521-0.564) and 0.544 (95 % CI 0.523-0.565), respectively. Although the original Gail model cannot be applied directly to populations with different underlying rates of invasive breast cancer, it can readily be recalibrated to provide unbiased estimates of absolute risk in such populations. Nevertheless, its limited discrimination ability at the individual level highlights the need to develop extended models with additional strong risk factors.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2013 Feb.138(1):249-59. doi: 10.1007/s10549-013-2428-y.

1;Reappraisal of the options for colorectal cancer screening in England.;Abstract AIM: The aim was to use newly available data to estimate the cost effectiveness and endoscopy requirements of screening options for colorectal cancer (CRC) to inform screening policy in England. METHODS: A state transition model simulated the life experience of a cohort of individuals in the general population of England with normal colon/rectal epithelium through to the development of adenomas and CRC and subsequent death. CRC natural history model parameters and screening test characteristics were estimated simultaneously by a process of model calibration. This process was fitted to observed data on CRC incidence in the absence of screening, data from existing screening programmes, and data from the UK flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening trial. The costs, effects and resource impact were evaluated for a range of screening options involving the guaiac or immunochemical faecal occult blood test (gFOBT/iFOBT) and FS. RESULTS: The model suggests that screening strategies involving FS or iFOBT may produce additional benefits compared with the current policy of biennial gFOBT for 60-74-year-olds. The age at which a single FS screen results in the greatest quality-adjusted life year gain was 55, with similar gains for ages between 52 and 58. Strategies which combined FS and iFOBT showed further benefits and improved economic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies which combine different screening modalities may provide greater clinical and economic benefits. The collection of comprehensive screening data using a uniform format will enable comparative analysis across screening programmes in different countries, will improve our understanding of the disease and will allow identification of optimal screening modalities. © 2012 The Authors.

0;Quasi-multistatic MIST beamforming for the early detection of breast cancer.;Abstract Microwave imaging via space-time (MIST) beamforming has been shown to be one of the most promising imaging modalities for detecting small malignant breast tumors. This paper outlines two modifications to the MIST system developed by Hagness for the early detection of breast cancer, resulting in a quasi-multistatic MIST beamformer (multi-MIST). Multistatic MIST beamforming involves illuminating the breast with an ultrawideband (UWB) signal from one antenna while collecting the reflections at an array of antennas, as opposed to traditional monostatic MIST beamforming where only the transmitting antenna records the reflections from the breast. In order to process the multistatic data, traditional data-adaptive artifact removal algorithms have to be modified to accommodate signals from all antennas. Also, the MIST beamforming algorithm, which spatially focuses the signal and compensates for frequency-dependent propagation effects, has to be modified. The algorithms are tested on a 2-D anatomically accurate finite-difference time-domain model of the breast. The multi-MIST beamformer described here is shown to offer an improved signal to clutter ratio when compared to the traditional monostatic MIST beamformer.;IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 2010 Apr.57(4):830-40. doi: 10.1109/TBME.2009.2016392.

0;Quantitative target sizes for breast tumor detection prior to metastasis: a prerequisite to rational design of 4D scanners for breast screening.;Abstract It is important to determine a breast cancer tumor target size for new screening equipment and molecular detection. Records of women aged 40-69 years diagnosed in 1988-1997 with a nonmetastasized, node-negative, or node-positive T1-stage breast cancer were abstracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) public-use database. The linear, Gompertzian, lognormal, and power-exponential models of the effect of tumor size on breast cancer specific mortality were compared using corresponding transforms of size in multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Criteria for comparison were the linearization of the size transforms and the Nagelkerke R2N index for the Cox models. Our results show that the assumption of a linear effect of tumor size was rejected by the linearity test (P=0.05). The Gompertzian, lognormal, and power-exponential transforms satisfied the test with P-values of 0.08, 0.29, and 0.14, respectively. The corresponding R2N were 0.08410, 0.08420, and 0.08414, respectively, showing a marginally best fit with the lognormal model, which was selected as a model for small tumors. The lognormal function with unadjusted crude death rates gave a lognormal-location parameter of 25 and shape parameter of 1.7, while the corresponding values in multivariate models were 18 and 2, respectively. The derivation of the lognormal model indicates tumor growth acceleration starting at 3 mm (unadjusted crude data) or 2 mm (multivariate model). The breast cancer tumor target size for screening equipment, whether by imaging or molecular detection, is therefore 2 mm.;Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2005 Feb.4(1):11-21.;Vinh-Hung V1, Gordon R.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Diagnostic Imaging/methods,Diagnostic Imaging/trends*,Female,Humans,Lymphatic Metastasis*,Mammography,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Proportional Hazards Models,Sensitivity and Specificity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Quantifying lead-time bias in risk factor studies of cancer through simulation.;Abstract PURPOSE: Lead-time is inherent in early detection and creates bias in observational studies of screening efficacy, but its potential to bias effect estimates in risk factor studies is not always recognized. We describe a form of this bias that conventional analyses cannot address and develop a model to quantify it. METHODS: Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data form the basis for estimates of age-specific preclinical incidence, and log-normal distributions describe the preclinical duration distribution. Simulations assume a joint null hypothesis of no effect of either the risk factor or screening on the preclinical incidence of cancer, and then quantify the bias as the risk-factor odds ratio (OR) from this null study. This bias can be used as a factor to adjust observed OR in the actual study. RESULTS: For this particular study design, as average preclinical duration increased, the bias in the total-physical activity OR monotonically increased from 1% to 22% above the null, but the smoking OR monotonically decreased from 1% above the null to 5% below the null. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of nontrivial bias in fixed risk-factor effect estimates demonstrates the importance of quantitatively evaluating it in susceptible studies. Copyright � 2013 Elsevier Inc.

0;Putting National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance into practice: a cost minimization model of a national roll-out of liquid based cytology in England.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: In 2003, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) advised that liquid based cytology (LBC) should be adopted for cervical screening in England. The aim of this study was to explore the cost implications of implementing the NICE guidance in cytology laboratories. The ThinPrep technology was used as the case study. METHODS: An optimization model was developed to analyze options for leasing alternative LBC processing machines with different capacities. Variables entered in the model included: the cost of the contract with the supplier, the laboratory labor cost, and inter-laboratory transport costs. All costs referred to the 2005-06 financial year. A simulation program calculated mileages within laboratory networks. Alternative strategies for contracting by laboratories acting independently and by Quality Assessment Regional Centres (QARC) were analyzed. RESULTS: Centralizing the processing of specimens in hub and spoke laboratory networks was the least costly strategy. Total annual costs for England using existing transport links were 14,807,000 UK pounds for 5-year contracts. If all laboratories installed processors, the annual cost for 5-year contracts placed by QARCs was 14,941,000 UK pounds compared with 16,359,000 pounds if the laboratories placed their own contracts. Three-year contracts averaged an additional 1 million UK pounds: 15,912,000 pounds for networks and 17,304,000 pounds for independent laboratory contracts. CONCLUSIONS: Deciding on the mode of implementation of a NICE guidance can be challenging for decision makers. These cost minimization appraisal techniques are equally applicable to national screening programs in general and to other health technologies for which there are significant cost implications associated with innovative policy directives.;Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2008 Fall.24(4):391-8. doi: 10.1017/S0266462308080513.;Stoykova B1, Kuzmanov G, Dowie R.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Cervix Uteri/cytology*,Costs and Cost Analysis,Cytological Techniques/economics*,England,Female,Humans,Models, Econometric,National Health Programs/organization & administration,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Department of Health/United Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Psychological impact of prostate biopsy: physical symptoms, anxiety, and depression.;Abstract PURPOSE: To investigate the psychological impact of prostate biopsy, including relationships between physical biopsy-related symptoms and anxiety and depression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort of 1,147 men, nested within the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment trial and recommended to receive prostate biopsy, completed questionnaires assessing physical and psychological harms after biopsy in the Prostate Biopsy Effects study. Psychological impact was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and scores were compared according to experiences of biopsy-related symptoms at biopsy, and at 7 and 35 days afterward, and in relation to biopsy results. RESULTS: A total of 1,144 men (99.7%) returned questionnaires at biopsy, with 1,090 (95.0%) and 1,016 (88.6%) responding at 7 and 35 days postbiopsy. Most men experienced biopsy-related symptoms as no problem or a minor problem, and overall levels of anxiety and depression were low and similar to normative levels. Of men receiving a negative biopsy result (n = 471), anxiety was greater in those experiencing problematic biopsy-related symptoms compared with those experiencing nonproblematic symptoms at 7 days for the following symptoms: pain (P < .001), shivers, (P = .020), hematuria (P < .001), hematochezia (P < .001), and hemoejaculate (P < .001). Anxiety was reduced, although symptoms were not, after 35 days. Overall levels of anxiety were low across all time points except at the 35-day assessment among men who had received a cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Problematic postbiopsy symptoms can lead to increased anxiety, distinct from distress related to diagnosis of prostate cancer. Men and doctors need to consider these additional potential harms of biopsy when deciding whether to initiate prostate-specific antigen testing.;J Clin Oncol. 2013 Nov 20.31(33):4235-41. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2012.45.4801.

0;Prostatitis, sexually transmitted diseases, and prostate cancer: the California Men's Health Study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Prostatitis and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) have been positively associated with prostate cancer in previous case-control studies. However, results from recent prospective studies have been inconclusive. METHODOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the association between prostatitis, STDs, and prostate cancer among African American, Asian American, Latino, and White participants of the California Men's Health Study. Our analysis included 68,675 men, who completed a detailed baseline questionnaire in 2002-2003. We identified 1,658 incident prostate cancer cases during the follow-up period to June 30, 2006. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Overall, men having a history of prostatitis had an increased risk of prostate cancer than men with no history (RR = 1.30. 95% CI: 1.10-1.54). Longer duration of prostatitis symptoms was also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (P trend = 0.003). In addition, among men screened for prostate cancer (1 or 2 PSA tests), a non-significant positive association was observed between prostatitis and prostate cancer (RR = 1.10. 95% CI: 0.75-1.63). STDs were not associated with overall prostate cancer risk. In racial/ethnic stratified analysis, Latinos reporting any STDs had an increased risk of disease than those with no STDs (RR = 1.43. 95% CI: 1.07-1.91). Interestingly, foreign-born Latinos displayed a larger risk associated with STDs (RR = 1.87. 95% CI: 1.16-3.02) than U.S. born Latinos (RR = 1.15. 95% CI: 0.76-3.02). CONCLUSION: In summary, results from this prospective study suggest that prostatitis and STDs may be involved in prostate cancer susceptibility. While we cannot rule out the possible influence of incidental detection, future studies are warranted to further investigate the role of infectious agents related to prostatitis and STDs in prostate cancer development.;PLoS One. 2010 Jan 15.5(1):e8736. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008736.;Cheng I1, Witte JS, Jacobsen SJ, Haque R, Quinn VP, Quesenberry CP, Caan BJ, Van Den Eeden SK.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,California/epidemiology,Cohort Studies,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Proportional Hazards Models,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Prostatitis/epidemiology*,Sexually Transmitted Diseases/epidemiology*,Surveys and Questionnaires,R25 CA112355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R25T CA 112355-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Prostate-specific antigen testing accuracy in community practice.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Most data on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing come from urologic cohorts comprised of volunteers for screening programs. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PSA testing for detecting prostate cancer in community practice. METHODS: PSA testing results were compared with a reference standard of prostate biopsy. Subjects were 2,620 men 40 years and older undergoing (PSA) testing and biopsy from 1/1/95 through 12/31/98 in the Albuquerque, New Mexico metropolitan area. Diagnostic measures included the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios. RESULTS: Cancer was detected in 930 subjects (35%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.67 and the PSA cutpoint of 4 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 33%. The likelihood ratio for a positive test (LR+) was 1.28 and 0.42 for a negative test (LR-). PSA testing was most sensitive (90%) but least specific (27%) in older men. Age-specific reference ranges improved specificity in older men (49%) but decreased sensitivity (70%), with an LR+ of 1.38. Lowering the PSA cutpoint to 2 ng/ml resulted in a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 20%, and an LR+ of 1.19. CONCLUSIONS: PSA testing had fair discriminating power for detecting prostate cancer in community practice. The PSA cutpoint of 4 ng/ml was sensitive but relatively non-specific and associated likelihood ratios only moderately revised probabilities for cancer. Using age-specific reference ranges and a PSA cutpoint below 4 ng/ml improved test specificity and sensitivity, respectively, but did not improve the overall accuracy of PSA testing.;BMC Fam Pract. 2002 Oct 24.3:19.

1;Prostate cancer, the PSA test and academic detailing in Australian general practice: an economic evaluation.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether introduction of a national education program for GPs to improve decision making relating to the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing for screening represents 'value-for-money' from the perspective of the Australian Government. METHODS: The annual equivalent costs and consequences of a proposed national program in steady state operation are estimated for Australia using 1996 as the reference year. Because of the controversy about the efficacy of screening using PSA testing, two scenarios are modelled. Uncertainty in the model is examined using Monte Carlo simulation methods. RESULTS: In scenario one, our model predicts that the national program would cost dollars 12.5 million (gross) or dollars 6.6 million (net), would reduce the burden of disease by 4.7% of total DALYs due to prostate cancer in those aged 70 and over, with no loss of life and an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of dollars 16,000/DALY (gross) and dollars 8,500/DALY (net). In scenario two, the proposed program would cost dollars 12.5 million (gross) or dollars 7.1 million (net), would reduce the burden of disease by 3.1% of total, increase by 44 the prostate cancer deaths at an ICER of dollars 24,000/DALY (gross) and dollars 14,000/DALY (net). CONCLUSIONS: These findings, with an overall health benefit at moderate cost and acceptable ICER, support the case for consideration of a national education program on the assumption that prostate cancer screening over age 70 does not reduce mortality. A larger Australian study currently being conducted should provide stronger evidence on the value of implementing a full national program.;Aust N Z J Public Health. 2005 Aug.29(4):349-57.;Stone CA1, May FW, Pinnock CB, Elwood M, Rowett DS.;Evaluation Studies,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Australia/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods,Decision Support Techniques,Family Practice/economics,Family Practice/education*,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Models, Biological,Models, Econometric*,Monte Carlo Method,National Health Programs/economics*,Prostate-Specific Antigen*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis,Prostatic Neoplasms/economics,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Training Support/economics*,Uncertainty,Prostate-Specific Antigen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Prostate cancer detection using machine learning techniques by employing combination of features extracting strategies.;Abstract Prostate is a second leading causes of cancer deaths among men. Early detection of cancer can effectively reduce the rate of mortality caused by Prostate cancer. Due to high and multiresolution of MRIs from prostate cancer require a proper diagnostic systems and tools. In the past researchers developed Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems that help the radiologist to detect the abnormalities. In this research paper, we have employed novel Machine learning techniques such as Bayesian approach, Support vector machine (SVM) kernels: polynomial, radial base function (RBF) and Gaussian and Decision Tree for detecting prostate cancer. Moreover, different features extracting strategies are proposed to improve the detection performance. The features extracting strategies are based on texture, morphological, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT), and elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs) features. The performance was evaluated based on single as well as combination of features using Machine Learning Classification techniques. The Cross validation (Jack-knife k-fold) was performed and performance was evaluated in term of receiver operating curve (ROC) and specificity, sensitivity, Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), false positive rate (FPR). Based on single features extracting strategies, SVM Gaussian Kernel gives the highest accuracy of 98.34% with AUC of 0.999. While, using combination of features extracting strategies, SVM Gaussian kernel with texture + morphological, and EFDs + morphological features give the highest accuracy of 99.71% and AUC of 1.00.;Cancer Biomark. 2018 Feb 6.21(2):393-413. doi: 10.3233/CBM-170643.;Hussain L1,2, Ahmed A2, Saeed S2, Rathore S3, Awan IA2, Shah SA2, Majid A2, Idris A4, Awan AA2.;Bayes Theorem,Humans,Machine Learning/utilization*,Male,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology,Support Vector Machine/utilization*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Prostate cancer characteristics and survival in males of African Ancestry according to place of birth: data from Brooklyn-New York, Guyana, Tobago and Trinidad.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer mortality rates for African-Americans are much higher than Caucasians and a similar trend is observed for prostate cancer survival. Data on recently immigrated African-descent men are lacking. METHODS: Using cancer registry data from Brooklyn, NY and two countries in the Caribbean (Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago), survival rates were estimated. We also examined whether Black race or Caribbean birthplace predict prostate cancer survival among males living in the United States (US). RESULTS: The Caribbean cases were diagnosed at a later age than those in the US (Guyana: 74.5 years, Trinidad and Tobago: 72.4 years, Brooklyn: 65.8 years). Patients in the Caribbean had a worse 5-year survival rate compared to those in the US (41.6% vs. 84.4%) but for immigrant Caribbean-born males living in the US the 5-year survival rate was not significantly different from African-Americans (78.1%, 95% CI: 70.9-83.7% vs. 81.4%, 95% CI: 69.5-89.1%, P = 0.792). The risk of death for Caribbean-born was more than three times higher than US-born men (HR: 3.43, 95% CI: 2.17-5.44, adjusted for ethnicity, stage, and mean age of diagnosis). A mean age of diagnosis >65 years old and stage IV disease, but not ethnicity, were found to be independently associated with the risk of death. CONCLUSION: The survival disadvantage for Caribbean-born patients may be partly due to later diagnosis. Interventions focused on screening, education about the disease and early detection could potentially reduce cancer mortality in this population.;Prostate. 2010 Jul 1.70(10):1102-9. doi: 10.1002/pros.21144.;Mutetwa B1, Taioli E, Attong-Rogers A, Layne P, Roach V, Ragin C.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Africa/ethnology,African Americans/statistics & numerical data*,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Guyana/epidemiology,Humans,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Male,Middle Aged,New York City/epidemiology,Proportional Hazards Models,Prostatic Neoplasms/ethnology,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality*,Risk Factors,Trinidad and Tobago/epidemiology,R13CA130596A/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P20 CA132385-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R13 CA130596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P20 CA132385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P20CA132385-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R13 CA130596-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Prostate cancer biomarker discovery using high performance mass spectral serum profiling.;Abstract Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most widely used serum biomarker for early detection of prostate cancer (PCA). Nevertheless, PSA level can be falsely elevated due to prostatic enlargement, inflammation or infection, which limits the PSA test specificity. The objective of this study is to use a machine learning approach for the analysis of mass spectrometry data to discover more reliable biomarkers that distinguish PCA from benign specimens. Serum samples from 179 prostate cancer patients and 74 benign patients were analyzed. These samples were processed using ProXPRESSION Biomarker Enrichment Kits (PerkinElmer). Mass spectra were acquired using a prOTOF 2000 matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization orthogonal time-of-flight (MALDI-O-TOF) mass spectrometer. In this study, we search for potential biomarkers using our feature selection method, the Extended Markov Blanket (EMB). From the new marker selection algorithm, a panel of 26 peaks achieved an accuracy of 80.7%, a sensitivity of 83.5%, a specificity of 74.4%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 87.9%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 68.2%. On the other hand, when PSA alone was used (with a cutoff of 4.0ng/ml), a sensitivity of 66.7%, a specificity of 53.6%, a PPV of 73.5%, and a NPV of 45.4% were obtained.;Comput Methods Programs Biomed. 2009 Oct.96(1):33-41. doi: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2009.04.003.

0;Projecting mammographic screens.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: The purpose of mammographic screening is to reduce mortality from breast cancer. This study describes a method for projecting the number of screens to be performed by a mammographic screening programme, and applies this method in the context of New South Wales, Australia. METHOD: The total number of mammographic screens was projected as the sum of initial screens and re-screens, and is based on projections of the population, rates of new recruitment, rates of attrition within the programme, and the mix of screening intervals. The baseline scenario involved: 70% participation of women aged 50-69 years, 90% return rate for the second and subsequent re-screens, 5% annual screens (95% biennial screens), and a specified population projection. The results were assessed with respect to variations in these assumptions. RESULTS: The projections were strongly influenced by: the rate of screening of the target age group. the proportion of women re-screened annually. and the rates of attrition within the programme. Although demographic change had a notable effect, there was little difference between different population projections. Standard assumptions about attrition within the programme suggest that the current target participation rates in NSW may not be achieved in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: A practical model for projecting mammographic screens for populations is described which is capable of forecasting the number of screens under different scenarios. IMPLICATIONS: Projections of mammographic screens provide important information for the planning and financing of equipment and personnel, and for testing the effects of variations in important operational parameters. Re-screening attrition is an important contributor to screening viability.;J Med Screen. 2000.7(3):146-51.;Parr N1, Boyages J, Taylor R, Anura P, Callaghan T.;Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Demography,Female,Humans,Mammography*/statistics & numerical data,Mass Screening*/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,New South Wales/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Program-specific cost-effectiveness analysis: breast cancer screening policies for a safety-net program.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Every Woman Counts (EWC), a California breast cancer screening program, faced challenging budget cutbacks and policy choices. METHODS: A microsimulation model evaluated costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of EWC program mammography policy options on coverage for digital mammography (which has a higher cost than film mammography but recent legislation allowed reimbursement at the lower film rate). screening eligibility age. and screening frequency. Model inputs were based on analyses of program claims data linked to California Cancer Registry data, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, and the Medi-Cal literature. Outcomes included number of procedures, cancers, cancer deaths, costs, and incremental cost per life-year. RESULTS: Projected model outcomes matched program data closely. With restrictions on the number of clients screened, strategies starting screening at age 40 years were dominated (not cost-effective). This finding was highly robust in sensitivity analyses. Compared with no screening, biennial film mammography for women aged 50 to 64 years was projected to reduce 15-year breast cancer mortality by nearly 7.8% at $18,999 per additional life-year, annual film mammography was $106,428 per additional life-year, and digital mammography $180,333 per additional life-year. This more effective, more expensive strategy was projected to reduce breast cancer mortality by 8.6%. Under equal mammography reimbursement, biennial digital mammography beginning at age 50 years was projected to decrease 15-year breast cancer mortality by 8.6% at an incremental cost per additional life-year of $17,050. CONCLUSIONS: For the EWC program, biennial screening mammography starting at age 50 years was the most cost-effective strategy. The impact of digital mammography on life expectancy was small. Program-specific cost-effectiveness analysis can be completed in a policy-relevant time frame to assist policymakers faced with difficult program choices.

0;Prognostic Value of Geriatric 8 and Identification of Seniors at Risk for Hospitalized Patients Screening Tools for Patients With Lung Cancer.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Because of the time-consuming aspect of geriatric assessments, cancer specialists are seeking shorter screening tools to distinguish fit and frail patients. We analyzed the predictive value of the Geriatric 8 (G8) and Identification of Seniors at Risk for Hospitalized Patients (ISAR-HP) in elderly patients with lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 2014 to April 2016, the data from patients with lung cancer aged > 70 years at 2 teaching hospitals in the Netherlands were included in a database. The patients were classified as potentially frail if they had a G8 of ≤ 14 or ISAR-HP of ≥ 2. RESULTS: Of the 142 included patients (median age, 77 years. interquartile range, 73-82 years), 108 (76%) were potentially frail. After correction for possible confounders, the potentially frail patients had a significantly greater risk of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 4.08. 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-9.99. P = .02). Higher disease stage (HR, 1.72. 95% CI, 1.40-2.12. P < .001) was also a significant predictor of mortality. however, initial treatment (standard or otherwise) and age were not. When using both screening instruments separately, an impaired score on the G8 and higher disease stage were the variables remaining in the regression analyses (HR for impaired G8, 3.01. 95% CI, 1.35-6.72. P < .001). Patients with impaired scores on the ISAR-HP and G8 had more geriatric impairments than did patients with only an impaired G8 score. CONCLUSION: G8 screening is useful for the prognostication of elderly patients with lung cancer and could be used in combination with ISAR-HP to increase specificity at the cost of sensitivity. Using the ISAR-HP as the only screening tool would be insufficient. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;Clin Lung Cancer. 2017 Nov.18(6):660-666.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.cllc.2017.02.006.

0;Prognosis of younger and older patients with early breast cancer.;Abstract The use of mammography in recent years has resulted in an increase in the detection of small breast cancers. The beneficial effects of early detection on breast cancer mortality seem to differ with age. To obtain more insight into this matter we studied the long-term prognosis of patients with early invasive breast cancers (T1) in three age groups: 144 patients of age 40-49, 402 patients of age 50-69 and 192 patients 70 years or older at diagnosis. In all age groups, patients with a tumour of 1 cm or less have a longer breast cancer specific survival than patients with a tumour larger than 2 cm. The survival advantage in the case of tumours of a size rounded to 1.5 cm compared with tumours larger than 2 cm in the under age 50 group was marginal (and not significant). However, older patients with tumours of this size do have a significantly improved survival. It is more difficult to improve survival in younger patients through early detection, partly because of an apparent early metastatic potential of their tumours. A reduction in breast cancer mortality might be expected in women younger than 50 years of age only if a substantial proportion of the invasive cancers are detected before their size exceeds 1 cm.;Br J Cancer. 1996 Feb.73(3):382-5.;Peer PG1, Verbeek AL, Mravunac M, Hendriks JH, Holland R.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Female,Humans,Lymphatic Metastasis,Middle Aged,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models,Survival Analysis,Time Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Prognosis of metachronous contralateral breast cancer according to stage at diagnosis: the importance of early detection.;Abstract Detection of metachronous contralateral breast cancer (MCBC) is an important aspect of follow-up among the many women previously diagnosed with first primary breast cancer (FPBC). While randomized studies have demonstrated the efficacy of early detection of FPBC, such findings cannot be generalized to women previously diagnosed with breast cancer since they were specifically excluded from participation. In this study, we determined if detection of MCBC at stage 0-I improves prognosis among women diagnosed with stage 0-III FPBC. Using data from the 1990-2000 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, we defined MCBC as contralateral breast cancer that occurred at least 6 months after stage 0-III FPBC diagnosis. Women who developed a MCBC were categorized as having stage 0-I versus stage II-IV. To avoid lead-time bias, survival of MCBC was measured from the date of FPBC. Among 170,453 women who had been diagnosed with stage 0-III FPBC, 2904 were subsequently diagnosed with MCBC. Of these 2904 women, 329 died from breast cancer and 194 died from other causes. Seventy percent of women were diagnosed with stage 0-I MCBC. An 81% survival benefit existed for stage 0-I MCBC relative to those with stage II-IV MCBC in multivariable analysis (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.19. 95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.25). The findings are robust for various subpopulations. Unmeasured confounding was unlikely to explain the observed results in sensitivity analysis. For women with stage 0-III FPBC, diagnosis of stage 0-I MCBC is associated with an 81% reduction in risk of breast cancer death.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2006 Sep.99(1):91-5.

0;Probing multifractality in tissue refractive index: prospects for precancer detection.;Abstract Multiresolution analysis on the spatial refractive index inhomogeneities in the epithelium and connective tissue regions of a human cervix reveals a clear signature of multifractality. Importantly, the derived multifractal parameters, namely, the generalized Hurst exponent and the width of the singularity spectrum, derived via multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, shows interesting differences between tissues having different grades of precancers. The refractive-index fluctuations are found to be more anticorrelated, and the strength of multifractality is observed to be considerably stronger in the higher grades of precancers. These observations on the multifractal nature of tissue refractive-index variations may prove to be valuable for developing light-scattering approaches for noninvasive diagnosis of precancer and early-stage cancer.;Opt Lett. 2013 Jan 15.38(2):211-3. doi: 10.1364/OL.38.000211.;Das N1, Chatterjee S, Soni J, Jagtap J, Pradhan A, Sengupta TK, Panigrahi PK, Vitkin IA, Ghosh N.;Algorithms,Cervix Uteri/pathology,Early Detection of Cancer/instrumentation,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Fractals,Humans,Light,Microscopy, Interference/methods,Models, Statistical,Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Precancerous Conditions/diagnosis*,Precancerous Conditions/pathology,Refractometry*,Reproducibility of Results,Scattering, Radiation,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Probabilistic cost-effectiveness modeling of different breast cancer screening policies in Slovenia.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To determine the most cost-effective screening policy for population-based mammography breast cancer screening in Slovenia using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. METHODS: A time-dependent Markov model for breast cancer was constructed. General principles of cost-effectiveness analysis with multiple strategies were used to compare the costs and effects of 36 different screening policies. Using probability distributions for model parameters, the true effect of uncertainty across model input parameters on expected costs and effects was explored. The results from probabilistic simulation analysis are presented in a form of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier. RESULTS: With the presented analysis, it was shown that a 1-year screening interval in population breast cancer screening would produce less benefits at higher costs than less intensive screening and that a 2-year interval would be cost-effective only at high values of society's willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Therefore, the optimal screening policy should be chosen among 3-year-interval policies. CONCLUSIONS: Based on commonly quoted thresholds of society's willingness to pay per QALY of $50,000, the optimal approach in the Slovenian population would be screening women aged from 40 to 80 years every 3 years.;Value Health. 2008 Mar-Apr.11(2):139-48. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00223.x.;Rojnik K1, Naversnik K, Mateović-Rojnik T, Primiczakelj M.;Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Diagnosis,Female,Health Care Costs,Health Policy/economics*,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Models, Statistical*,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Slovenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Primary screening for human papillomavirus compared with cytology screening for cervical cancer in European settings: cost effectiveness analysis based on a Dutch microsimulation model.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To investigate, using a Dutch model, whether and under what variables framed for other European countries screening for human papillomavirus (HPV) is preferred over cytology screening for cervical cancer, and to calculate the preferred number of examinations over a woman's lifetime. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on a Dutch simulation model. Base case analyses investigated the cost effectiveness of more than 1500 different screening policies using the microsimulation model. Subsequently, the policies were compared for five different scenarios that represent different possible scenarios (risk of cervical cancer, previous screening, quality associated test characteristics, costs of testing, and prevalence of HPV). SETTING: Various European countries. POPULATION: Unvaccinated women born between 1939 and 1992. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Optimal screening strategy in terms of incremental cost effectiveness ratios (costs per quality adjusted life years gained) compared with different cost effectiveness thresholds, for two levels of sensitivity and costs of the HPV test. RESULTS: Primary HPV screening was the preferred primary test over the age of 30 in many considered scenarios. Primary cytology screening was preferred only in scenarios with low costs of cytology and in scenarios with a high prevalence of HPV in combination with high costs of HPV testing. CONCLUSIONS: Most European countries should consider switching from primary cytology to HPV screening for cervical cancer. HPV screening must, however, only be implemented in situations where screening is well controlled.;BMJ. 2012 Mar 5.344:e670. doi: 10.1136/bmj.e670.;de Kok IM1, van Rosmalen J, Dillner J, Arbyn M, Sasieni P, Iftner T, van Ballegooijen M.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Alphapapillomavirus/isolation & purification*,Computer Simulation*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Europe,Female,Humans,Models, Economic*,Netherlands,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis*,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Sensitivity and Specificity,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears/economics*,C8162/A10406/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Preference for human papillomavirus-based cervical cancer screening: results of a choice-based conjoint study in Zambia.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the conditions under which Zambian women with a history of cervical cancer screening by visual inspection with acetic acid might switch to human papillomavirus-based testing in the future. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a choice-based conjoint survey in a sample of women recently screened by visual inspection in Lusaka, Zambia. The screening attribute considered in hypothetical-choice scenarios included screening modality, sex and age of the examiner, whether screening results would be presented visually, distance from home to the clinic, and wait time for results. RESULTS: Of 238 women in the sample, 208 (87.4%) provided responses sufficiently reliable for analysis. Laboratory testing on a urine sample was the preferred screening modality, followed by visual screening, laboratory testing on a self-collected vaginal specimen, and laboratory testing on a nurse-collected cervical specimen. Market simulation suggested that only 39.7% (95% CI = 33.8-45.6) of the respondents would prefer urine testing offered by a female nurse in her 30s over visual inspection of the cervix conducted by a male nurse in his 20s if extra wait time were as short as 1 hour and the option of viewing how their cervix looks like were not available. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, for some women, the level of preference for human papillomavirus-based screening strategies may depend highly on the process and conditions of service delivery.;J Low Genit Tract Dis. 2015 Apr.19(2):119-23. doi: 10.1097/LGT.0000000000000081.;Chamot E1, Mulambia C, Kapambwe S, Shrestha S, Parham GP, Macwan'gi M, Mwanahamuntu MH.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adolescent,Adult,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/methods*,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Patient Acceptance of Health Care*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Young Adult,Zambia,R21 CA124336/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R21CA124336/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Pre-existing diabetes and breast cancer prognosis among elderly women.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of pre-existing diabetes on breast cancer prognosis. METHODS: Women (n=2833) with centrally confirmed invasive breast cancer in the Women's Health Initiative, who were linked to Medicare claims data (CMS) were followed from the date of breast cancer diagnosis to date of death or 20 September 2013. Information on diabetes was identified through the CMS Chronic Condition Warehouse algorithm. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios for overall mortality. A competing risks model (proportional subdistribution) model was used to estimate hazard ratios for breast cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS: Women with diabetes were more likely to have factors related to delayed diagnosis (less recent mammograms, and more advanced cancer stage) and were less likely to receive radiation therapy. Compared with women without diabetes, women with diabetes had significantly increased risk of overall mortality (HR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.23-2.01) and had nonsignificantly increased risk for breast cancer-specific mortality (HR=1.36, 95% CI: 0.86-2.15) before adjustment for factors related to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Adjustment for these factors resulted in a little change in the association of diabetes with overall mortality risk, but further attenuated the point estimate for breast cancer-specific mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides additional evidence that pre-existing diabetes increases the risk of total mortality among women with breast cancer. Very large studies with data on breast cancer risk factors, screening and diagnostic delays, treatment choices, and the biological influence of diabetes on breast cancer will be needed to determine whether diabetes also increases the risk for breast cancer-specific mortality.;Br J Cancer. 2015 Sep 1.113(5):827-32. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2015.249.

0;Predictive models in diagnosing indolent cancer.;Abstract The early detection of prostate cancer has led to the increased incidence of tumors that are unlikely to become symptomatic during life: so-called indolent cancers. The ability to predict indolent prostate cancer is needed to avoid over treatment by unnecessary invasive therapies and to select men for active surveillance. For this report, the currently available nomograms that predict these low-risk tumors were reviewed. Many of these nomograms were based on clinical patient series, thus, their general application is restricted. Those nomograms based on screening series of the general population need further validation before generalized application is feasible. Cancer 2009.115(13 suppl):3100-6.

0;Predicting the stage shift as a result of breast cancer screening in low- and middle-income countries: a proof of concept.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To provide proof of concept for a simple model to estimate the stage shift as a result of breast cancer screening in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Stage shift is an essential early detection indicator and an important proxy for the performance and possible further impact of screening programmes. Our model could help LIMCs to choose appropriate control strategies. METHODS: We assessed our model concept in three steps. First, we calculated the proportional performance rates (i.e. index number Z) based on 16 screening rounds of the Nijmegen Screening Program (384,884 screened women). Second, we used linear regression to assess the association between Z and the amount of stage shift observed in the programme. Third, we hypothesized how Z could be used to estimate the stage shift as a result of breast cancer screening in LMICs. RESULTS: Stage shifts can be estimated by the proportional performance rates (Zs) using linear regression. Zs calculated for each screening round are highly associated with the observed stage shifts in the Nijmegen Screening Program (Pearson's R: 0.798, R square: 0.637). CONCLUSIONS: Our model can predict the stage shifts in the Nijmegen Screening Program, and could be applied to settings with different characteristics, although it should not be straightforwardly used to estimate the impact on mortality. Further research should investigate the extrapolation of our model to other settings. As stage shift is an essential screening performance indicator, our model could provide important information on the performance of breast cancer screening programmes that LMICs consider implementing. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.;J Med Screen. 2015 Mar.22(1):8-19. doi: 10.1177/0969141314559956.

1;Predicting the change in breast cancer deaths in Spain by 2019: a Bayesian approach.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer mortality rates have been decreasing in Spain since 1992. Recent changes in demography, breast cancer therapy, and early detection of breast cancer may change this trend. METHODS: Using breast cancer mortality data from years 1990 to 2009, we sought to predict the changes in the burden of breast cancer mortality during the years 2005-2019 through a Bayesian age-period-cohort model. The net change in the number of breast cancer deaths between the periods of 2015-2019 and 2005-2009 was separated into changes in population demographics and changes in the risk of death from breast cancer. RESULTS: During the period 1990-2009, breast cancer mortality rates decreased (age-standardized rates per 100,000 women-years 50.6 in 1990-1994 vs. 41.1 in 2005-2009), whereas the number of breast cancer deaths increased (28,149 in 1990-1994. 29,926 in 2005-2009). There was a decrease in the number of cases among women 45-64 years of age (10,942 in 1990-1994. 8,647 in 2005-2009). Changes in population demographics contribute to a total increase of 12.5-12.8% comparing periods 2005-2009 versus 2015-2019, whereas changes in the risk of death from breast cancer contribute to a reduction of 12.9-13.7%. We predict a net decline of 0.1-1.2% in the absolute number of breast cancer deaths comparing these time periods. CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in the risk of death from breast cancer may exceed the projected increase in deaths from growing population size and aging in Spain. These changes may also explain the decrease in the absolute number of breast cancer deaths in Spain since 2005.;Epidemiology. 2013 May.24(3):454-60. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0b013e31828b0866.;Clèries R1, Martínez JM, Moreno V, Yasui Y, Ribes J, Borràs JM.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Bayes Theorem,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Female,Forecasting,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Spain/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Predicting impacts of mass-screening policy changes on breast cancer mortality.;Abstract The aim of this study is to present a methodology for taking into account the mass-screening invitation data in breast cancer mortality predictions, particularly in assessing impacts of screening policy changes on the short-term predictions. The methodology is applied to a database that includes observed year- and age-specific screening invitation schemes in Finnish municipalities from the time period 1987-2001. The target year for predictions is 2012. To predict mortality, breast cancer incidence and patients' survival from breast cancer are modelled with the screening data included. The knowledge of breast cancer survival together with the other cause survival is then used to calculate the number of breast cancer deaths caused by observed (1987-2001) and predicted (2002-2012) incident cases in Finland. Survival from breast cancer was estimated with a parametric mixture model where the patient population is assumed to be a combination of cured and uncured patients. This approach provides a way of modelling the hazard of fatal cases and the proportion of cured cases simultaneously. In other cause survival, the patients' hazard was allowed to differ from that of the general population. Breast cancer mortality predictions are presented according to three alternative future scenarios of screening policy. The results show no major differences between predictions yielded by alternative scenarios: Any policy change would have at the most a 3.0 per cent impact on breast cancer mortality in the near future.;Stat Med. 2008 Nov 10.27(25):5235-51. doi: 10.1002/sim.3345.;Seppänen J1, Heinävaara S, Hakulinen T.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Finland/epidemiology,Forecasting,Humans,Mass Screening*/statistics & numerical data,Models, Statistical,Policy Making*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Potential impact of population-based colorectal cancer screening in Canada.;Abstract Randomized controlled trials (RCT) have shown the efficacy of screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) using the faecal occult blood test (FOBT) with follow-up by colonoscopy. We evaluated the potential impact of population-based screening by FOBT followed by colonoscopy in Canada: mortality reduction, cost-effectiveness, and resource requirements. The microsimulation model POHEM was adapted to simulate CRC screening using Canadian data and RCT results about test sensitivity and specificity, participation, incidence, staging, progression, mortality and direct health care costs. In Canada, biennial screening of 67% of individuals aged 50-74 in the year 2000 resulted in an estimated 10-year CRC mortality reduction of 16.7%. The life expectancy of the cohort increased by 15 days on average and the demand for colonoscopy rose by 15% in the first year. The estimated cost of screening was $112 million per year or $11,907 per life-year gained (discounted at 5%). Potential effectiveness would depend on reaching target participation rates and finding resources to meet the demand for FOBT and colonoscopy.

1;Potential impact of antiretroviral therapy and screening on cervical cancer mortality in HIV-positive women in sub-Saharan Africa: a simulation.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Despite having high cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates, screening for cervical precancerous lesions remains infrequent in sub-Saharan Africa. The need to screen HIV-positive women because of the higher prevalence and faster progression of cervical precancerous lesions may be heightened by the increased access to highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Policymakers need quantitative data on the effect of HAART and screening to better allocate limited resources. Our aim was to quantify the potential effect of these interventions on cervical cancer mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model of a cohort of HIV-positive women in Cameroon. Published data on the prevalence, progression and regression of lesions as well as mortality rates from HIV, cervical cancer and other causes were incorporated into the model. We examined the potential impact, on cumulative cervical cancer mortality, of four possible scenarios: no HAART and no screening (NHNS), HAART and no screening (HNS), HAART and screening once on HAART initiation (HSHI), and HAART and screening once at age 35 (HS35). Our model projected that, compared to NHNS, lifetime cumulative cervical cancer mortality approximately doubled with HNS. It will require 262 women being screened at HAART initiation to prevent one cervical cancer death amongst women on HAART. The magnitudes of these effects were most sensitive to the rate of progression of precancerous lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Screening, even when done once, has the potential of reducing cervical cancer mortality among HIV-positive women in Africa. The most feasible and cost-effective screening strategy needs to be determined in each setting.;PLoS One. 2011 Apr 4.6(4):e18527. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0018527.;Atashili J1, Smith JS, Adimora AA, Eron J, Miller WC, Myers E.;Anti-HIV Agents/therapeutic use*,Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active,Cameroon/epidemiology,Female,HIV/physiology*,Humans,Models, Theoretical*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/drug therapy,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology*,Anti-HIV Agents,K24 HD059358/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States,P30 AI050410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Potential cost-effectiveness of one-time screening for lung cancer (LC) in a high risk cohort.;Abstract The development of low-dose helical computed-tomography (CT) scanning to detect nodules as small as a few mm has sparked renewed interest in lung cancer (LC) screening. The objective of this study was to assess the potential health effects and cost-effectiveness of a one-time low-dose helical CT scan to screen for LC. We created a decision analysis model using baseline results from the Early Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP). Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry public-use database. screening program costs estimated from 1999 Medicare reimbursement rates. and annual costs of managing cancer and non-cancer patients from Riley et al. (1995) [Med Care 1995.33(8):828-841] and Taplin et al. (1995) [J Natl Cancer Inst 1995.87(6):417-26]. The main outcome measures included years of life, cost estimates of baseline diagnostic screening and follow up, and cost-effectiveness of screening. We found that in a very high-risk cohort (LC prevalence of 2.7%) of patients between 60 and 74 years of age, a one-time screen appears to be cost-effective at $5940 per life year saved. In a lower risk general population of smokers (LC prevalence of 0.7%), a one-time screen appears to be cost-effective at $23100 per life year. Even when a lead-time bias of 1 year is incorporated into the model for a low risk population, the cost-effectiveness is estimated at $58183 per life year. Based on the assumptions embedded in this model, one-time screening of elderly high-risk patients for LC appears to be cost-effective.;Lung Cancer. 2001 Jun.32(3):227-36.;Marshall D1, Simpson KN, Earle CC, Chu C.;Evaluation Studies,Aged,Cohort Studies,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Trees,Humans,Life Expectancy,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric*,Risk Factors,Survival Analysis,Tomography, X-Ray Computed/economics*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Post-inhaled corticosteroid pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia increases lung cancer in patients with COPD.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have been associated with decreased lung cancer risk. However, they have been associated with pulmonary infections (tuberculosis [TB] and pneumonia) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). TB and pneumonia have increased lung cancer risk. The association between post-ICS pulmonary infections and lung cancer remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study from 2003 to 2010 using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Among the 1,089,955 patients with COPD, we identified 8813 new users of ICS prescribed for a period of 3 months or more and 35,252 non-ICS users who were randomly matched for sex, age and date of ICS use from 2003 to 2005. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of pulmonary infections in patients with/without ICS use. RESULTS: The HRs for lung cancer in ICS users with sequential lung infections were as follows. 2.42 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.28-4.58) for individuals with TB, 2.37 (95 % CI, 1.01-5.54) for TB and pneumonia, and 1.17(95 % CI, 0.69-1.98) for those with pneumonia. For non-ICS users with pulmonary infections, the HRs were 1.68 (95 % CI, 0.78-3.65) for individual with TB and pneumonia, 1.42 (95 % CI, 0.89-2.26) for TB, and 0.95 (95 % CI, 0.62-1.46) for individuals with pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: COPD patients with TB /or pneumonia who used ICS had increased risk of lung cancer. Because the overall prognosis of lung cancer remains poor, screening tests are recommended for patients with these conditions.;BMC Cancer. 2016 Oct 10.16(1):778.;Wu MF1,2, Jian ZH3, Huang JY3, Jan CF4, Nfor ON3, Jhang KM3,5, Ku WY3, Ho CC6, Lung CC3,7, Pan HH1,8, Wu MC4, Liaw YP9,10.;Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage,Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects*,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Comorbidity,Female,Humans,Incidence,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Lung Neoplasms/etiology*,Male,Middle Aged,Pneumonia/complications*,Pneumonia/epidemiology,Pneumonia/etiology*,Population Surveillance,Proportional Hazards Models,Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/complications*,Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/drug therapy,Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/epidemiology,Registries,Risk Factors,Taiwan/epidemiology,Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/complications*,Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/epidemiology,Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/etiology*,Young Adult,Adrenal Cortex Hormones;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Population-based mammography screening below age 50: balancing radiation-induced vs prevented breast cancer deaths.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: Exposure to ionizing radiation at mammography screening may cause breast cancer. Because the radiation risk increases with lower exposure age, advancing the lower age limit may affect the balance between screening benefits and risks. The present study explores the benefit-risk ratio of screening before age 50. METHODS: The benefits of biennial mammography screening, starting at various ages between 40 and 50, and continuing up to age 74 were examined using micro-simulation. In contrast with previous studies that commonly used excess relative risk models, we assessed the radiation risks using the latest BEIR-VII excess absolute rate exposure-risk model. RESULTS: The estimated radiation risk is lower than previously assessed. At a mean glandular dose of 1.3 mGy per view that was recently measured in the Netherlands, biennial mammography screening between age 50 and 74 was predicted to induce 1.6 breast cancer deaths per 100,000 women aged 0-100 (range 1.3-6.3 extra deaths at a glandular dose of 1-5 mGy per view), against 1121 avoided deaths in this population. Advancing the lower age limit for screening to include women aged 40-74 was predicted to induce 3.7 breast cancer deaths per 100,000 women aged 0-100 (range 2.9-14.4) at biennial screening, but would also prevent 1302 deaths. CONCLUSION: The benefits of mammography screening between age 40 and 74 were predicted to outweigh the radiation risks.;Br J Cancer. 2011 Mar 29.104(7):1214-20. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.67.

0;Physicians' opinions and use of controversial technologies. The case of mammographic screening in Norway.;Abstract In a survey of 196 Norwegian radiologists and 37 breast imaging centers, physicians' preferences were found to be likely to influence the use of mammography. In their decision making, the radiologists appear to be influenced by income motives and by perceptions of the risk of misdiagnosing breast cancer. Despite opinions favorable to mammographic screening, most radiologists would prefer a CT scanner or a magnetic resonance imaging unit to a mammographic unit if the x-ray department were in a position to acquire capital equipment.;Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 1995 Spring.11(2):316-26.;Kristiansen IS1, Natvig NL, Sager EM.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Attitude of Health Personnel*,Chi-Square Distribution,Female,Humans,Income/statistics & numerical data,Linear Models,Male,Mammography/economics,Mammography/instrumentation,Mammography/statistics & numerical data,Mammography/utilization*,Middle Aged,Norway,Practice Patterns, Physicians'/economics,Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Performance of the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool Among Women Age 75 Years and Older.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT, Gail model) is commonly used for breast cancer prediction. however, it has not been validated for women age 75 years and older. METHODS: We used Nurses' Health Study (NHS) data beginning in 2004 and Women's Health Initiative (WHI) data beginning in 2005 to compare BCRAT's performance among women age 75 years and older with that in women age 55 to 74 years in predicting five-year breast cancer incidence. BCRAT risk factors include: age, race/ethnicity, age at menarche, age at first birth, family history, history of benign breast biopsy, and atypia. We examined BCRAT's calibration by age by comparing expected/observed (E/O) ratios of breast cancer incidence. We examined discrimination by computing c-statistics for the model by age. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Seventy-three thousand seventy-two NHS and 97 081 WHI women participated. NHS participants were more likely to be non-Hispanic white (96.2% vs 84.7% in WHI, P < .001) and were less likely to develop breast cancer (1.8% vs 2.0%, P = .02). E/O ratios by age in NHS were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 1.23, age 57-74 years) and 1.31 (95% CI = 1.18 to 1.45, age ≥ 75 years, P = .02), and in WHI 1.03 (95% CI = 0.97 to 1.09, age 55-74 years) and 1.10 (95% CI = 1.00 to 1.21, age ≥ 75 years, P = .21). E/O ratio 95% confidence intervals crossed one among women age 75 years and older when samples were limited to women who underwent mammography and were without significant illness. C-statistics ranged between 0.56 and 0.58 in both cohorts regardless of age. CONCLUSIONS: BCRAT accurately predicted breast cancer for women age 75 years and older who underwent mammography and were without significant illness but had modest discrimination. Models that consider individual competing risks of non-breast cancer death may improve breast cancer risk prediction for older women. © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

0;Performance of a semiautomated Papanicolaou smear screening system: results of a population-based study conducted in Guanacaste, Costa Rica.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Automated cytology devices have utility in quality assurance applications, but the effectiveness of these devices in primary screening is unknown. METHODS: Enrollment smears obtained from 7323 women participating in a population-based study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute were screened manually in Costa Rica and then evaluated independently in the U.S. with the PAPNET system (Neuromedical Systems, Inc., Suffern, NY), a semiautomated, neural network-based device. Smears with abnormal PAPNET images were microscopically rescreened and then diagnosed by a U.S. cytopathologist. ThinPrep slides (Cytyc Corporation, Boxborough, MA), prepared from rinses of the cytologic sampler, and cervigrams (National Testing Laboratories, Fenton, MO) were also evaluated. Women with any abnormal cytologic diagnosis or a positive cervigram were referred for colposcopy with biopsy and definitive therapy if indicated. RESULTS: Based on the U.S. cytotechnologist's review of the PAPNET images, 1017 (13.9%) of 7323 smears were selected for manual screening, resulting in the selection of 492 (6.7%) possibly abnormal slides for referral to the U.S. pathologist. Ultimately, 312 smears (4.3% of the total) were diagnosed as containing squamous cells of undetermined significance or a more severe abnormality (> or =ASCUS), resulting, hypothetically, in the referral of 66.5% of women with a final diagnosis of a squamous intraepithelial lesion or a more severe abnormality (> or =SIL) and 86.0% of patients with > or =high grade SIL. Conventional microscopic screening performed in Costa Rica resulted in the hypothetical referral of 6.5% of patients with > or =ASCUS for colposcopy, including 69.5% of patients with > or =SIL and 79.8% of those with > or =high grade SIL. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, PAPNET-assisted cytologic screening accurately identified smears obtained from women with high grade SIL or carcinoma.

1;Performance and Cost-Effectiveness of Computed Tomography Lung Cancer Screening Scenarios in a Population-Based Setting: A Microsimulation Modeling Analysis in Ontario, Canada.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) results indicate that computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening for current and former smokers with three annual screens can be cost-effective in a trial setting. However, the cost-effectiveness in a population-based setting with >3 screening rounds is uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening in a population-based setting in Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the effects of screening eligibility criteria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This study used microsimulation modeling informed by various data sources, including the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP), Ontario Cancer Registry, smoking behavior surveys, and the NLST. Persons, born between 1940 and 1969, were examined from a third-party health care payer perspective across a lifetime horizon. Starting in 2015, 576 CT screening scenarios were examined, varying by age to start and end screening, smoking eligibility criteria, and screening interval. Among the examined outcome measures were lung cancer deaths averted, life-years gained, percentage ever screened, costs (in 2015 Canadian dollars), and overdiagnosis. The results of the base-case analysis indicated that annual screening was more cost-effective than biennial screening. Scenarios with eligibility criteria that required as few as 20 pack-years were dominated by scenarios that required higher numbers of accumulated pack-years. In general, scenarios that applied stringent smoking eligibility criteria (i.e., requiring higher levels of accumulated smoking exposure) were more cost-effective than scenarios with less stringent smoking eligibility criteria, with modest differences in life-years gained. Annual screening between ages 55-75 for persons who smoked ≥40 pack-years and who currently smoke or quit ≤10 y ago yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $41,136 Canadian dollars ($33,825 in May 1, 2015, United States dollars) per life-year gained (compared to annual screening between ages 60-75 for persons who smoked ≥40 pack-years and who currently smoke or quit ≤10 y ago), which was considered optimal at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000 Canadian dollars ($41,114 May 1, 2015, US dollars). If 50% lower or higher attributable costs were assumed, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this scenario was estimated to be $38,240 ($31,444 May 1, 2015, US dollars) or $48,525 ($39,901 May 1, 2015, US dollars), respectively. If 50% lower or higher costs for CT examinations were assumed, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this scenario was estimated to be $28,630 ($23,542 May 1, 2015, US dollars) or $73,507 ($60,443 May 1, 2015, US dollars), respectively. This scenario would screen 9.56% (499,261 individuals) of the total population (ever- and never-smokers) at least once, which would require 4,788,523 CT examinations, and reduce lung cancer mortality in the total population by 9.05% (preventing 13,108 lung cancer deaths), while 12.53% of screen-detected cancers would be overdiagnosed (4,282 overdiagnosed cases). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the overall results were most sensitive to variations in CT examination costs. Quality of life was not incorporated in the analyses, and assumptions for follow-up procedures were based on data from the NLST, which may not be generalizable to a population-based setting. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer screening with stringent smoking eligibility criteria can be cost-effective in a population-based setting.;PLoS Med. 2017 Feb 7.14(2):e1002225. doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002225. eCollection 2017 Feb.;Ten Haaf K1, Tammemägi MC2, Bondy SJ3,4, van der Aalst CM1, Gu S5, McGregor SE6, Nicholas G7, de Koning HJ1, Paszat LF3,5.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,False Positive Reactions,Female,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Medical Overuse,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Mortality,Ontario,Tomography, X-Ray Computed/economics*,U01 CA199284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA152956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Performance analysis of a machine learning flagging system used to identify a group of individuals at a high risk for colorectal cancer.;Abstract Individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC) have a tendency to intestinal bleeding which may result in mild to severe iron deficiency anemia, but for many colon cancer patients hematological abnormalities are subtle. The fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is used as a pre-screening test whereby those with a positive FOBT are referred to colonscopy. We sought to determine if information contained in the complete blood count (CBC) report coud be processed automatically and used to predict the presence of occult colorectal cancer (CRC) in the setting of a large health services plan. Using the health records of the Maccabi Health Services (MHS) we reviewed CBC reports for 112,584 study subjects of whom 133 were diagnosed with CRC in 2008 and analysed these with the MeScore tool. The odds ratio for being diagnosed with CRC in 2008 was calculated with regards to the MeScore, using cutoff levels of 97% and 99% percentiles. For individuals in the highest one percentile, the odds ratio for CRC was 21.8 (95% CI 13.8 to 34.2). For the majority of the individuals with cancer, CRC was not suspected at the time of the blood draw. Frequent use of anticoagulants, the presence of other gastrointestinal pathologies and non-GI malignancies were assocaitged with false positive MeScores. The MeScore can help identify individuals in the population who would benefit most from CRC screening, including those with no clinical signs or symptoms of CRC.;PLoS One. 2017 Feb 9.12(2):e0171759. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0171759. eCollection 2017.;Kinar Y1, Akiva P1, Choman E2, Kariv R3,4, Shalev V5, Levin B2, Narod SA6,7, Goshen R2.;Aged,Colonoscopy,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Data Interpretation, Statistical,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Early Detection of Cancer/statistics & numerical data,Female,Humans,Machine Learning*,Male,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Occult Blood*,Referral and Consultation,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;PCR based high risk HPV testing is superior to neural network based screening for predicting incident CIN III in women with normal cytology and borderline changes.;Abstract BACKGROUND/AIMS: To improve the accuracy of conventional cytology in cervical cancer screening, high risk human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and neural network based screening have been developed. This study assessed the power of both techniques to detect women at risk of developing incident CIN III. that is, CIN III detected during the follow up of women with normal cytology and borderline nuclear changes. METHODS: A cohort of 2250 women, 34-54 years of age, who attended population based cervical cancer screening from 1988 to 1991 and had normal smears or borderline nuclear changes was followed. All smears were tested for high risk HPV and the smears were rescreened using neural network based screening. The value of neural network based screening for predicting incident CIN III during a mean follow up period of 6.4 years was compared with that of high risk HPV testing. In addition, morphological markers presumed to be related to HPV were correlated with HPV status. RESULTS: Thirteen (0.6%) women had incident CIN III. Both high risk HPV positivity and abnormal cytology were associated with an increased risk for incident CIN III (odds ratio, 240 and 22, respectively) and high risk HPV positivity was associated with abnormal cytology. The sensitivity of high risk HPV testing for predicting incident CIN III was much higher than that of neural network based screening (92% and 46%, respectively). None of the morphological markers assessed, including koilocytosis, was correlated with high risk HPV status. CONCLUSION: High risk HPV testing is superior to neural network based screening in identifying women at risk of developing CIN III. For women with normal cytology and borderline changes and a negative high risk HPV test, the screening interval can be considerably prolonged.;J Clin Pathol. 2000 Aug.53(8):606-11.;Rozendaal L1, Westerga J, van der Linden JC, Walboomers JM, Voorhorst FJ, Risse EK, Boon ME, Meijer CJ.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis*,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Predictive Value of Tests,Risk Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Patterns of breast cancer mortality trends in Europe.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To identify patterns of variation in breast cancer mortality in Europe (1980-2010), using a model-based approach. METHODS: Mortality data were obtained from the World Health Organization database and mixed models were used to describe the time trends in the age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR). Model-based clustering was used to identify clusters of countries with homogeneous variation in ASMR. RESULTS: Three patterns were identified. Patterns 1 and 2 are characterized by stable or slightly increasing trends in ASMR in the first half of the period analysed, and a clear decline is observed thereafter. in pattern 1 the median of the ASMR is higher, and the highest rates were achieved sooner. Pattern 3 is characterised by a rapid increase in mortality until 1999, declining slowly thereafter. CONCLUSION: This study provides a general model for the description and interpretation of the variation in breast cancer mortality in Europe, based in three main patterns.

0;Parametric optimization for tumour identification: bioheat equation using ANOVA and the Taguchi method.;Abstract Breast cancer is the number one killer disease among women. It is known that early detection of a tumour ensures better prognosis and higher survival rate. In this paper an intelligent, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tool is developed for aiding breast cancer detection objectively. This tool is based on thermographic scanning of the breast surface in conjunction with numerical simulation of the breast using the bioheat equation. The medical applications of thermographic scanning make use of the skin temperature as an indication of an underlying pathological process. The thermal pattern over a breast tumour reflects the vascular reaction to the abnormality. Hence an abnormal temperature pattern may be an indicator of an underlying tumour. Seven important parameters are identified and analysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed using a 2n design (n = number of parameters, 7). The effect and importance of the various parameters are analysed. Based on the above 2(7) design, the Taguchi method is used to optimize the parameters in order to ensure the signal from the tumour maximized compared with the noise from the other factors. The model predicts that the ideal setting for capturing the signal from the tumour is when the patient is at basal metabolic activity with a correspondingly lower subcutaneous perfusion in a low temperature environment.;Proc Inst Mech Eng H. 2000.214(5):505-12.;Sudharsan NM1, Ng EY.;Validation Studies,Analysis of Variance*,Artifacts,Bias,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/etiology,Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods*,Female,Humans,Models, Statistical*,Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted*,Predictive Value of Tests,Risk Factors,Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted*,Singapore/epidemiology,Thermal Conductivity,Thermography/methods*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of breast cancer: microsimulation modelling estimates based on observed screen and clinical data.;Abstract There is a delicate balance between the favourable and unfavourable side-effects of screening in general. Overdiagnosis, the detection of breast cancers by screening that would otherwise never have been clinically diagnosed but are now consequently treated, is such an unfavourable side effect. To correctly model the natural history of breast cancer, one has to estimate mean durations of the different pre-clinical phases, transition probabilities to clinical cancer stages, and sensitivity of the applied test based on observed screen and clinical data. The Dutch data clearly show an increase in screen-detected cases in the 50 to 74 year old age group since the introduction of screening, and a decline in incidence around age 80 years. We had estimated that 3% of total incidence would otherwise not have been diagnosed clinically. This magnitude is no reason not to offer screening for women aged 50 to 74 years. The increases in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are primarily due to mammography screening, but DCIS still remains a relatively small proportion of the total breast cancer problem.;Breast Cancer Res. 2006.8(1):202.

1;Option appraisal of population-based colorectal cancer screening programmes in England.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and resource impact of faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSIG) screening options for colorectal cancer to inform the Department of Health's policy on bowel cancer screening in England. METHODS: We developed a state transition model to simulate the life experience of a cohort of individuals without polyps or cancer through to the development of adenomatous polyps and malignant carcinoma and subsequent death in the general population of England. The costs, effects and resource impact of five screening options were evaluated: (a) FOBT for individuals aged 50-69 (biennial screening). (b) FOBT for individuals aged 60-69 (biennial screening). (c) once-only FSIG for individuals aged 55. (d) once-only FSIG for individuals aged 60. and (e) once-only FSIG for individuals aged 60, followed by FOBT for individuals aged 61-70 (biennial screening). RESULTS: The model suggests that screening using FSIG with or without FOBT may be cost-saving and may produce additional benefits compared with a policy of no screening. The marginal cost-effectiveness of FOBT options compared to a policy of no screening is estimated to be below pound3000 per quality adjusted life year gained. CONCLUSIONS: Screening using FOBT and/or FSIG is potentially a cost-effective strategy for the early detection of colorectal cancer. However, the practical feasibility of alternative screening programmes is inevitably limited by current pressures on endoscopy services.;Gut. 2007 May.56(5):677-84.

0;Occupational exposure to human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus: a comparative analysis of risk.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate the occupational risk from infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in terms of loss of (quality-adjusted) life expectancy, and to compare that risk to those posed by other hazards faced by health care workers. DESIGN: Decision-analytic model. RESULTS: For a 30-year-old female health care worker (unvaccinated for hepatitis B virus [HBV]), the loss of life expectancy from a needlestick from a symptomatic HIV-positive (HIV+) patient is 39 days (range, 17 to 93 days), as compared with a loss of 17 days from a needlestick from a patient who is hepatitis-B-surface-antigen-positive (HBsAg+), and 38 days from a needlestick from a patient who is hepatitis-B-e-antigen-positive (HBeAg+). When morbidity is included in the analysis of risk (through calculation of the quality-adjusted loss of life expectancy), the risk from both HBV and HIV increases. The quality-adjusted loss of life expectancy due to a needlestick exposure from a symptomatic HIV+ patient is 45 days (range, 20 to 108 days), as compared with a quality-adjusted loss of life expectancy of 48 days from a needlestick from an HBsAg+ patient, and 109 days from a needlestick from a patient who is known to be HBeAg+. By comparison, a cross-country automobile trip is associated with a loss of life expectancy of approximately 1 day. The 45- to 50-day loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy from percutaneous exposures to HIV and HBV is approximately the same magnitude as the gain in life expectancy from 10 years of annual screening for breast cancer with mammography and physical examination. CONCLUSIONS: The risk associated with percutaneous exposures to symptomatic HIV+ patients is comparable to other risks that health care workers have faced knowingly and have accepted in the recent past. However, the loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with a needlestick exposure is significant. Identification of cost-effective methods that increase the safety of medical personnel but also ensure full access to high-quality care for HIV+ patients should be a high priority.;Am J Med. 1992 May.92(5):503-12.;Owens DK1, Nease RF Jr.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/transmission*,Adult,California,Female,HIV*,Health Personnel*,Hepatitis B/transmission*,Hepatitis B virus*,Hospitals, University,Humans,Life Expectancy*,Models, Statistical,Needlestick Injuries/complications,Occupational Diseases/etiology,Occupational Exposure/statistics & numerical data*,Probability,Risk Factors,Time Factors,1 T32 HS0043-01/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Notes on testing non-inferiority under the partial verification design with a confirmatory procedure limited to screen positives.;Abstract When a new test with fewer invasions or less expenses to administer than the traditional test is developed, we may be interested in testing whether the former is non-inferior to the latter with respect to test accuracy. We define non-inferiority via both the odds ratio (OR) of correctly identifying a case and the OR of correctly identifying a non-case between two tests under comparison. We focus our discussion on testing the non-inferiority of a new screening test to a traditional screening test when a confirmatory procedure is performed only on patients with screen positives. On the basis of well-established methods for paired-sample data, we derive an asymptotic test procedure and an exact test procedure with respect to the two ORs defined here. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we evaluate the performance of these test procedures in a variety of situations. We note that the test procedures proposed here can also be applicable if we are interested in testing non-inferiority with respect to the ratio of sensitivities and the ratio of specificities. We discuss interval estimation of these ORs and sample size calculation based on the asymptotic test procedure considered here. We use the data taken from a study of the prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) test and the digital rectal examination (DRE) test to illustrate the practical use of these test procedures, interval estimators and sample size calculation formula.;Contemp Clin Trials. 2012 May.33(3):563-71. doi: 10.1016/j.cct.2012.02.007.

0;Nipple aspirate fluid cytology and the Gail model for breast cancer risk assessment in a screening population.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines suggest that chemoprevention with tamoxifen may be appropriate for women who have a 5-year risk of breast cancer greater than 1.66% calculated using the Gail model. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether nipple aspirate fluid (NAF) cytology combined with the Gail model provides breast cancer risk assessment that is superior to either method alone. METHODS: Prospective observational cohort of 6,904 asymptomatic women. Breast cancer cases were identified through follow-up with the women and linkage to cancer registries. We used proportional hazards modeling to recalculate the coefficients for the predictor variables used in the Gail model. NAF cytology was added to create a second model. The two models were compared using the concordance statistic (c-statistic). RESULTS: During 14.6 years of follow-up, 400 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. There were 940 (14%) women with hyperplasia and 109 (1.6%) women with atypical hyperplasia found in NAF. Adding NAF cytology results to the Gail model significantly improved the model fit (P < 0.0001). The c-statistic for the Gail model was 0.62, indicating only modest discriminatory accuracy. Adding NAF cytology to the model increased the c-statistic to 0.64. NAF cytology results had the largest effect on discriminatory accuracy among women in the upper third of Gail model risk. The relative incidence for the highest quintile of risk score compared with the lowest quintile was 7.2 for the Gail model and 8.0 for the model including NAF cytology. CONCLUSION: NAF cytology has the potential to improve prediction models of breast cancer incidence, particularly for high-risk women.;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2005 Feb.14(2):324-8.;Tice JA1, Miike R, Adduci K, Petrakis NL, King E, Wrensch MR.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cohort Studies,Cytodiagnosis/methods*,Extracellular Fluid/cytology*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Nipples/secretion*,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Risk Assessment,Sensitivity and Specificity,Suction,P01CA13556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01CA47228/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;New technologies in cervical cancer precursor detection.;Abstract The current literature reflects three routes toward improving cervical cancer screening. The first is to improve the test qualities of cytology-based screening. The use of liquid-based cytology and computerized analysis of Papanicolaou tests are examples of attempts at this approach. Secondly, through various combinations of parallel or sequential tests, either the sensitivity or the specificity of a given test could be improved depending on the tests chosen and the order in which they were performed (eg, Papanicolaou test followed by human papillomavirus [HPV] or vice versa). Several excellent studies have been published this year on the use of HPV DNA testing as a primary screening modality and as an adjunct to the triage of mildly abnormal cytologic findings. The recent literature also reflects increasing interest in visual inspection of the cervix and self-collected samples for HPV testing as an equally effective and viable alternative to cytology in low-resource settings. A third possibility is to make use of advances in digital and spectroscopic techniques. In these cost-conscious times, a significant number of articles address the cost-effectiveness of these technologies and the real value of cervical cancer screening. This article reviews the current literature concerning both the advent of new cervical cancer screening technologies and the rediscovery of old ones.;Curr Opin Oncol. 2000 Sep.12(5):460-5.;Soler ME1, Blumenthal PD.;Review,Cytodiagnosis,DNA, Neoplasm/analysis,DNA, Viral/analysis,Female,Humans,Luminescent Measurements,Neural Networks (Computer),Precancerous Conditions/pathology*,Risk Factors,Spectrometry, Fluorescence,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/etiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/therapy,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,DNA, Neoplasm,DNA, Viral;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;New residuals for Cox regression and their application to outlier screening.;Abstract The identification of individuals who 'died far too early' or 'lived far too long' as compared to their survival probabilities from a Cox regression can lead to the detection of new prognostic factors. Methods to identify outliers are generally based on residuals. For Cox regression, only deviance residuals have been considered for this purpose, but we show that these residuals are not very suitable. Instead, we develop and propose two new types of residuals: the suggested log-odds and normal deviate residuals are simple and intuitively appealing and their theoretical properties and empirical performance make them very suitable for outlier identification. Finally, various practical aspects of screening for individuals with outlying survival times are discussed by means of a cancer study example.;Biometrics. 1999 Jun.55(2):523-9.;Nardi A1, Schemper M.;Biometry*,Humans,Linear Models,Male,Odds Ratio,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models*,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality,Survival Analysis*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;New prospective for non-invasive detection, grading, size evaluation, and tumor location of prostate cancer.;Abstract BACKGROUND: PSA blood test and other present screening tools fail to provide the required sensitivity and specificity and, at early stages, lack correlation with tumor grade, volume, and location. Thus alternative approaches are highly desired. We present and assess a novel method for PCa detection, grading, volume evaluation and tumor location, based on non-invasive zinc concentration mapping in the gland by means of a dedicated rectal probe. METHODS: Zinc-concentration values measured in histologically examined tissue fragments from needle biopsy of 598 patients were analyzed. They were used to generate computer simulated zinc-concentration maps, further analyzed with image-processing tools. The tumor detection performances versus Gleason grade were assessed. RESULTS: A significant increase of zinc depletion with increasing Gleason pattern (grade) classification was established. Tumor detection performance in zinc-concentration maps progressively improves with the cancer's first component score. Reliable information on the location, size and Gleason-grade combination of the lesion can be extracted for clinically relevant volumes. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc depletion in the prostate peripheral zone is the basis for a novel, non-invasive PCa detection, localization, volume evaluation and grading method. Its realization and application as a pre-biopsy and pre-treatment examination, or a follow-up tool, relies on the development of a dedicated transrectal probe. It should have significant impact on biopsy effectiveness, point at a possible extraprostatic extension and provide critical data for focal treatment. The information on tumor grade and distribution may have an important impact on disease management.;Prostate. 2010 Nov 1.70(15):1701-8. doi: 10.1002/pros.21205.;Cortesi M1, Fridman E, Volkov A, Shilstein SSh, Chechik R, Breskin A, Vartsky D, Raviv G, Ramon J.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adenocarcinoma/chemistry*,Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis,Adenocarcinoma/pathology*,Computer Simulation,Histocytochemistry,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Male,Neoplasm Staging/methods,Prostatic Neoplasms/chemistry*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis,Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology*,Zinc/analysis*,Zinc;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;New paradigm for ASCUS diagnosis using neural networks.;Abstract It was tested whether it was possible to reduce the atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) scores in a meaningful way by exploiting the cells selected by the neural networks of the PAPNET system. For this test, 2,000 routine smears were screened once by means of PAPNET and once conventionally in a laboratory in Amsterdam. From these 2,000 smears, 168 were diagnosed as ASCUS. In the second phase of the study, the diagnosis was based solely on the PAPNET images, and in addition, cases with immature cells (bare nuclei and cells with very little cytoplasm) in the PAPNET images were classified as ASCUS. Although, in this second phase, 75.6% of the cases were revised to negative, the cases with positive follow-up were all still classified as ASCUS. The negative predictive value remained at 100%, whereas the positive predictive value increased from 14.3 to 30%. By using the new paradigm (focusing on immature cells selected by the neural networks) for routine primary PAPNET screening in a laboratory in Leiden, the ASCUS scores were reduced from 10% (June of 1996) to 1.0% (early 1998), with promising follow-up results for the first half of 1997.;Diagn Cytopathol. 1998 Nov.19(5):361-6.;Kok MR1, Habers MA, Schreiner-Kok PG, Boon ME.;Cervix Uteri/pathology*,Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods*,Epithelial Cells/pathology*,False Negative Reactions,Female,Humans,Netherlands,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Precancerous Conditions/diagnosis,Precancerous Conditions/pathology,Predictive Value of Tests,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Vaginal Smears/methods*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Neural network-based screening (NNS) in cervical cytology: no need for the light microscope?;Abstract Neural network-based screening (NNS) of cervical smears can be performed as a so-called hybrid screening method, in which parts of the cases are additionally studied by light microscope, and it can also be used as pure NNS, in which the cytological diagnosis is based only on the digital images, generated by the NNS system. A random enriched sample of 985 cases, in a previous study diagnosed by hybrid NNS, was drawn to be screened by pure NNS. This study population comprised 192 women with (pre)neoplasia of the cervix, and 793 negative cases. With pure NNS, more cases were recognized as severely abnormal. with hybrid NNS, more cases were cytologically diagnosed as low-grade. For a threshold value > or = HSIL (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC) were 81% (95% CI, 75-88%) for pure NNS vs. 78% (95% CI, 75-81%) for hybrid NNS. For low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), the AUC was significantly higher for hybrid NNS (81%. 95% CI, 77-85%) than for pure NNS (75%. 95% CI, 70-80%). Pure NNS provides optimized prediction of HSIL cases or negative outcome. For the detection of LSIL, light microscopy has additional value.;Diagn Cytopathol. 2001 Jun.24(6):426-34.;Kok MR1, van Der Schouw YT, Boon ME, Grobbee DE, Kok LP, Schreiner-Kok PG, van der Graaf Y, Doornewaard H, van den Tweel JG.;Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis*,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/pathology,Cervix Uteri/pathology,Female,Humans,Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods*,Mass Screening/methods*,Microscopy,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Vaginal Smears;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Neural network processing can provide means to catch errors that slip through human screening of pap smears.;Abstract The problem of the false-negative smear deserves the attention of the cytologic community. We found that by using the PAPNET system, equipped with neural network programming, cancer cells can be detected in repeatedly misdiagnosed Pap smears. The correct diagnosis of these false-negative smears depended on the skills of the diagnostician to recognize the cells on one or more of the 128 tiles of the video display as abnormal, and to make the proper decision when to turn to light microscopy. In 8 of the 10 tested false-negative smears, the cancer cells were found exclusively in epithelial fragments. in two cases there were no more than five abnormal cells in the smear (which were detected by PAPNET). This study gave us insight into the nature of the false-negative problem and showed us that the application of neural network processing can provide means to catch errors that slip through human screening of Pap smears.;Diagn Cytopathol. 1993 Aug.9(4):411-6.;Boon ME1, Kok LP.;Clinical Competence,Clinical Laboratory Techniques/standards,Diagnostic Errors,False Negative Reactions,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Papanicolaou Test*,Predictive Value of Tests,Retrospective Studies,Vaginal Smears/standards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Natural history and screening model for high-risk human papillomavirus infection, neoplasia and cervical cancer in the Netherlands.;Abstract A simulation model is presented that assumes that persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is a necessary cause of cervical cancer. For the estimation of the model parameters, data of recent Dutch follow-up studies were reanalyzed. The predicted incidences of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1, CIN2 and CIN3) and abnormal cytology were validated with nationwide figures and population-based screening results. The model predicted a lifetime risk for cervical cancer of 2.9% with a peak at age 48 years. The predicted lifetime risk dropped to 0.4% when attending cervical screening. For women who were not hrHPV infected at 30 years, the lifetime risk was 1.6%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to check natural history assumptions that were only weakly identified from available data sets. The incidence of CIN3 observed with screening appeared a useful clinical end point as the predicted incidence was robust against changes in the sensitivity of cervical cytology and the duration to CIN3. The model can be used to study the health-economic benefits that can be achieved in nationwide screening when including an hrHPV test.;Int J Cancer. 2005 Jun 10.115(2):268-75.;Berkhof J1, de Bruijne MC, Zielinski GD, Meijer CJ.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/epidemiology,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology*,Computer Simulation*,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Genetics, Population,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Netherlands/epidemiology,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification*,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology,Papillomavirus Infections/virology*,Prognosis,Risk Factors,Survival Rate,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;National and regional breast cancer incidence and mortality trends in Mexico 2001-2011: Analysis of a population-based database.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in Mexican women since 2006. However, due to a lack of cancer registries, data is scarce. We sought to describe breast cancer trends in Mexico using population-based data from a national database and to analyze geographical and age-related differences in incidence and mortality rates. METHODS: All incident breast cancer cases reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System and all breast cancer deaths registered by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography in Mexico from 2001 to 2011 were included. Incidence and mortality rates were calculated for each age group and for 3 geographic regions of the country. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to examine trends in BC incidence and mortality. We estimated annual percentage change (APC) using weighted least squares log-linear regression. RESULTS: We found an increase in the reported national incidence, with an APC of 5.9% (95% CI 4.1-7.7, p<0.05). Women aged 60-65 had the highest increase in incidence (APC 7.89%. 95% CI 5.5 -10.3, p<0.05). Reported incidence rates were significantly increased in the Center and in the South of the country, while in the North they remained stable. Mortality rates also showed a significant increase, with an APC of 0.4% (95% CI 0.1-0.7, p<0.05). Women 85 and older had the highest increase in mortality (APC 2.99%, 95% CI 1.9-4.1. p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The reporting of breast cancer cases in Mexico had a continuous increase, which could reflect population aging, increased availability of screening, an improvement in the number of clinical facilities and better reporting of cases. Although an improvement in the detection of cases is the most likely explanation for our findings, our results point towards an epidemiological transition in Mexico and should help in guiding national policy in developing countries.

0;Multivariate distributions of clinical covariates at the time of cancer detection.;Abstract Many screening trials conducted in the past have generated a wealth of interesting data. These data represent an invaluable source of information for furthering our knowledge about the natural history of the disease. The traditional approach to modeling cancer screening tends to describe the process of tumor development in only one dimension, that is, the time natural history. A broader methodological idea is to construct a stochastic model of cancer development and detection that yields the multivariate distribution of observable variables at the time of diagnosis. By focusing on such multivariate observations, rather than just on the age of patients at diagnosis, this idea seeks to invoke an additional source of information (available only at the time of detection) in order to improve an estimation of unobservable quantitative parameters of cancer latency. In this article, we discuss modeling techniques that make the above-mentioned problems approachable. A special focus is placed on analytical tools for deriving joint distributions of clinical covariates at the time of cancer detection under an arbitrary screening protocol. In addition, some future research avenues and public health implications of the proposed approach are discussed.;Stat Methods Med Res. 2004 Dec.13(6):457-89.;Hanin LG1, Yakovlev AY.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Review,Aged,Early Diagnosis,Humans,Male,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Multivariate Analysis,Neoplasm Staging/statistics & numerical data*,Prostate-Specific Antigen,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Prostate-Specific Antigen,R01 AG14650-01A2/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA88177-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Multistate transitional models for measuring adherence to breast cancer screening: A population-based longitudinal cohort study with over two million women.;Abstract Objective Prior work on the disparities among women in breast cancer screening adherence has been methodologically limited. This longitudinal study determines and examines the factors associated with becoming adherent. Methods In a cohort of Canadian women aged 50-74, a three-state transitional model was used to examine adherence to screening for breast cancer. The proportion of time spent being non-adherent with screening was calculated for each woman during her observation window. Using age as the time scale, a relative rate multivariable regression was implemented under the three-state transitional model, to examine the association between covariates (all time-varying) and the rate of becoming adherent. Results The cohort consisted of 2,537,960 women with a median follow-up of 8.46 years. Nearly 31% of women were continually up-to-date with breast screening. Once a woman was non-adherent, the rate of becoming adherent was higher among longer term residents (relative rate = 1.289, 95% confidence interval 1.275-1.302), those from wealthier neighbourhoods, and those who had an identifiable primary care provider who was female or had graduated in Canada. Conclusion Individual and physician-level characteristics play an important role in a woman's adherence to screening. This work improves the quality of evidence regarding disparities among women in adherence to breast cancer screening and provides a novel methodological foundation to investigate adherence for other types of screening, including cervix and colorectal cancer screening.;J Med Screen. 2017 Jun.24(2):75-82. doi: 10.1177/0969141316654940.

1;Multi-state Markov models in cancer screening evaluation: a brief review and case study.;Abstract This work presents a brief overview of Markov models in cancer screening evaluation and focuses on two specific models. A three-state model was first proposed to estimate jointly the sensitivity of the screening procedure and the average duration in the preclinical phase, i.e. the period when the cancer is asymptomatic but detectable by screening. A five-state model, incorporating lymph node involvement as a prognostic factor, was later proposed combined with a survival analysis to predict the mortality reduction associated with screening. The strengths and limitations of these two models are illustrated using data from French breast cancer service screening programmes. The three-state model is a useful frame but parameter estimates should be interpreted with caution. They are highly correlated and depend heavily on the parametric assumptions of the model. Our results pointed out a serious limitation to the five-state model, due to implicit assumptions which are not always verified. Although it may still be useful, there is a need for more flexible models. Over-diagnosis is an important issue for both models and induces bias in parameter estimates. It can be addressed by adding a non-progressive state, but this may provide an uncertain estimation of over-diagnosis. When the primary goal is to avoid bias, rather than to estimate over-diagnosis, it may be more appropriate to correct for over-diagnosis assuming different levels in a sensitivity analysis. This would be particularly relevant in a perspective of mortality reduction estimation.;Stat Methods Med Res. 2010 Oct.19(5):463-86. doi: 10.1177/0962280209359848.

0;Multiple testing in disease mapping and descriptive epidemiology.;Abstract The problem of multiple testing is rarely addressed in disease mapping or descriptive epidemiology. This issue is relevant when a large number of small areas or diseases are analysed. Control of the family wise error rate (FWER), for example via the Bonferroni correction, is avoided because it leads to loss of statistical power. To overcome such difficulties, control of the false discovery rate (FDR), the expected proportion of false rejections among all rejected hypotheses, was proposed in the context of clinical trials and genomic data analysis. FDR has a Bayesian interpretation and it is the basis of the so called q-value, the Bayesian counterpart of the p-value. In the present work, we address the multiplicity problem in disease mapping and show the performance of the FDR approach with two real examples and a small simulation study. The examples consider testing multiple diseases for a given area or multiple areas for a given disease. Using unadjusted p-values for multiple testing, an inappropriately large number of areas or diseases at altered risk are identified, whilst FDR procedures are appropriate and more powerful than the control of the FWER with the Bonferroni correction. We conclude that the FDR approach is adequate to screen for high/low risk areas or for disease excess/deficit and useful as a complementary procedure to point estimates and confidence intervals.;Geospat Health. 2010 May.4(2):219-29.;Catelan D1, Biggeri A.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Algorithms,Bayes Theorem,Cluster Analysis,Computer Simulation,Disease Outbreaks/statistics & numerical data*,Epidemiologic Research Design*,Geography,Humans,Italy/epidemiology,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology,Lung Neoplasms/mortality*,Male,Poisson Distribution,Population Surveillance/methods,Risk,Selection Bias;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Multiple detection modalities and disease natural history of breast cancer.;Abstract Multiple detection modalities have increasingly gained attention in population-based screening. However, the disease natural history and its efficacy have been barely addressed. We reviewed a series of articles addressing multiple detection modalities including mammography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance image between 1995 and 2005. A stochastic model was developed to estimate transition parameters pertaining to the disease natural history defined by multiple detection modalities. The effectiveness of the combination of ultrasound or magnetic resonance image (MRI) with mammography was projected using a series of computer simulation models. The results indicated that multiple detection modalities may lead to reduced mortality. However, the benefit and the selection of detection modalities are affected by biological factors including age, breast tissue type and histological type. In addition, other social factors may also affect the utilization of multiple detection modalities.;Stud Health Technol Inform. 2007.129(Pt 1):78-81.;Chen TH1, Yen AM, Wu GH, Chen LS, Chiu YH.;Review,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Self-Examination,Disease Progression,Humans,Mammography,Mass Screening,Sensitivity and Specificity,Ultrasonography, Mammary;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Multi-excitation magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction for bioimpedance imaging.;Abstract Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) is an imaging approach proposed to conduct noninvasive electrical conductivity imaging of biological tissue with high spatial resolution. In the present study, based on the analysis of the relationship between the conductivity distribution and the generated MAT-MI acoustic source, we propose a new multi-excitation MAT-MI approach and the corresponding reconstruction algorithms. In the proposed method, multiple magnetic excitations using different coil configurations are employed and ultrasound measurements corresponding to each excitation are collected to derive the conductivity distribution inside the sample. A modified reconstruction algorithm is also proposed for the multi-excitation MAT-MI imaging approach when only limited bandwidth acoustic measurements are available. Computer simulation and phantom experiment studies have been done to demonstrate the merits of the proposed method. It is shown that if unlimited bandwidth acoustic data is available, we can accurately reconstruct the internal conductivity contrast of an object using the proposed method. With limited bandwidth data and the use of the modified algorithm we can reconstruct the relative conductivity contrast of an object instead of only boundaries at the conductivity heterogeneity. Benefits that come with this new method include better differentiation of tissue types with conductivity contrast using the MAT-MI approach, specifically for potential breast cancer screening application in the future.;IEEE Trans Med Imaging. 2010 Oct.29(10):1759-67. doi: 10.1109/TMI.2010.2052063.

0;Much of the variation in breast pathology quality assurance data in the UK can be explained by the random order in which cases arrive at individual centres, but some true outliers do exist.;Abstract AIMS: To investigate the role of random temporal order of patient arrival at screening centres in the variability seen in rates of node positivity and breast cancer grade between centres in the NHS Breast Screening Programme. METHODS AND RESULTS: Computer simulations were performed of the variation in node positivity and breast cancer grade with the random temporal arrival of patients at screening centres based on national UK audit data. Cumulative mean graphs of these data were plotted. Confidence intervals for the parameters were generated, using the binomial distribution. UK audit data were plotted on these control limit graphs. The results showed that much of the variability in the audit data could be accounted for by the effects of random order of arrival of cases at the screening centres. Confidence intervals of 99.7% identified true outliers in the data. CONCLUSIONS: Much of the variation in breast pathology quality assurance data in the UK can be explained by the random order in which cases arrive at individual centres.

0;Mortality from cervical cancer in Serbia in the period 1991-2011.;Abstract PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze trends of death rates for cervical cancer (CC) on territory of The Republic of Serbia in the period 1991-2011. METHODS: In this descriptive epidemiological study, unpublished data of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia were used for the analysis of mortality due to CC among women in Serbia, from 1991 to 2011. Three different types of rates were calculated: crude, age-specific and age-adjusted rates. The age-standardized rates were calculated by the direct method of standardization using the World Standard Population as standard. The trends were assessed by joinpoint linear regression analysis. An average annual percentage change (AAPC) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed for trends. RESULTS: The average age-standardized CC mortality rate (ASCCMR) was 7.03 per 100,000. The lowest value of the ASCCMR was at the beginning of the observed period (6.05 per 100,000) and the highest was 8.17 per 100,000 in 2008. The age-adjusted CC mortality rates have been continuously and significantly increasing (AAPC=+0.7, 95% CI=0.3- 1.1, p<0.05). In all age groups we found increasing trends, except in the age group of 65-74 years. CONCLUSION: Since ASCCMR has been steadily increasing during the period observed, reducing these rates is highly warranted. To achieve this target, an organized CC screening program is essential.;J BUON. 2015 Jan-Feb.20(1):231-4.;Naumovic T1, Miljus D, Djoric M, Zivkovic S, Perisic Z.;Age Distribution,Age Factors,Aged,Cause of Death/trends,Female,Humans,Linear Models,Middle Aged,Risk Factors,Serbia/epidemiology,Time Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Mortality among sheet metal workers participating in a medical screening program.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The Sheet Metal Occupational Health Institute Trust (SMOHIT) was formed in 1985 to examine the health hazards of the sheet metal industry in the U.S. and Canada through an asbestos disease screening program. A study of mortality patterns among screening program participants was undertaken. METHODS: A cohort of 17,345 individuals with 20 or more years in the trade and who participated in the asbestos disease screening program were followed for vital status and causes of death between 1986 and 2004. Data from the screening program included chest X-ray results by International Labour Office (ILO) criteria and smoking history. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) by cause were generated using U.S. death rates and Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate lung cancer risk relative to chest X-ray changes while controlling for smoking. RESULTS: A significantly reduced SMR of 0.83 (95% CI = 0.80-0.85) was observed for all causes combined. Statistically significant excess mortality was observed for pleural cancers, mesothelioma, and asbestosis in the SMR analyses. Both lung cancer and COPD SMRs increased consistently and strongly with increasing ILO profusion score. In Cox models, which controlled for smoking, increased lung cancer risk was observed among workers with ILO scores of 0/1 (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.89-1.54), with a strong trend for increasing lung cancer risk with increasing ILO profusion score >0/0. CONCLUSIONS: Sheet metal workers are at increased risk for asbestos-related diseases. This study contributes to the literature demonstrating asbestos-related diseases among workers with largely indirect exposures and supports an increased lung cancer risk among workers with low ILO profusion scores.;Am J Ind Med. 2009 Aug.52(8):603-13. doi: 10.1002/ajim.20725.;Dement J1, Welch L, Haile E, Myers D.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Canada/epidemiology,Child,Child, Preschool,Cohort Studies,Confidence Intervals,Construction Materials/toxicity*,Female,Humans,Infant,Lung Diseases/epidemiology,Lung Diseases/mortality,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology,Lung Neoplasms/mortality*,Male,Mass Screening*,Metals/toxicity*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Multivariate Analysis,Occupational Diseases/epidemiology,Occupational Diseases/mortality*,Occupational Exposure/adverse effects*,Occupational Health/statistics & numerical data,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Factors,United States/epidemiology,Young Adult,Metals,2 U54 OH008307-02/OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Modelling the likely effect of the increase of the upper age limit from 70 to 73 for breast screening in the UK National Programme.;Abstract The UK National Breast Screening Programme is planned to have the age range for invitation to screening expanded from 50-70 to 47-73. At the upper limit, this represents one additional screen taking place in the early 70s. We aimed to estimate the likely effect of this on breast cancer mortality and on overdiagnosis of breast cancer. We used estimates of breast cancer incidence and survival by detection mode (screening or symptomatic), screening lead time and mortality from competing causes to estimate the likely numbers of breast cancer deaths prevented per 1000 women screened, using both a stochastic continuous time model and a semi-deterministic discrete time model. In the continuous model, we estimated that per 1000 women screened 1.2 deaths would be prevented and in the discrete model 0.91 deaths. In the latter model, we also estimated that there would be around 6.8 years of life saved per 1000 women screened and an additional two diagnoses of breast cancer. These results suggest that the expansion of the upper age limit will be cost-effective. They remain to be confirmed by evaluation of the age extension. They provide prior estimates that may inform the evaluation of the age extension.;Stat Methods Med Res. 2010 Oct.19(5):547-55. doi: 10.1177/0962280209358140.

1;Modelling the impact of detecting and treating ductal carcinoma in situ in a breast screening programme.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Screening has substantially increased the detection of carcinoma in situ of the breast (CIS). Opinions vary as to whether this constitutes over-diagnosis or an opportunity to interrupt breast cancer's natural history. In England, incidence of invasive cancer and CIS increased in women of screening age (50-64 years), leading to a subsequent deficit in invasive incidence in women aged 65-69 years immediately beyond the invited age range. We aimed to model underlying incidence of invasive cancer and CIS expected in the absence of screening, and to quantify the likely relative contributions of their early detection to the observed reduction in invasive cancer in women of postscreening age. SETTING: UK NHS breast screening programme in England. METHODS: Poisson regression modelling was used to establish the underlying incidence of invasive and in situ cancers in the absence of screening. We then estimated age- and year-specific excess detection rates attributable to screening. Applying these to population figures we estimated conservatively the relative contributions of early diagnosis of CIS and invasive cancer at 50-64 years of age to the subsequent deficit in invasive cancer in women beyond invitation age (65-69 years), for screening early in the programme and at steady state. RESULTS: Our model estimated a 1.6% annual increase in incidence, giving an estimated deficit of 4.22 invasive cancers per 10,000 women aged 65-69 years in 1996. Carcinoma in situ contributed 13-17% to the deficit, assuming a mean six year lead time and 75-100% progression to invasive cancer. At steady state, with current screening performance and with lead times of 3-4 years (invasive cancer) and 6-9 years (CIS), invasive incidence might be reduced by 5-6 cancers per 10,000 women aged 65-69 years in 2010 (15-20% of underlying incidence), CIS contributing 20-40%. DISCUSSION: The longer lead time associated with CIS attenuates the impact its early detection has on subsequent invasive incidence. At steady state screening, its detection contributes significantly to the deficit in invasive incidence. Our results suggest that, cancer for cancer, there may be just as much benefit in detecting and treating a case of CIS as there is in treating a case of invasive cancer.;J Med Screen. 2004.11(3):117-25.;McCann J1, Treasure P, Duffy S.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Carcinoma in Situ/epidemiology*,Carcinoma, Ductal/epidemiology*,England/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Poisson Distribution,State Medicine;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Modelling the impact of changes in sensitivity on the outcomes of the UK breast screening programme.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact on breast cancer mortality of improving the sensitivity of breast screening programmes. METHODS: A Markov model was populated with data obtained from published statistics describing the UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme and the incidence and mortality of breast cancer in the UK. The model was used to study the impact of changes to the sensitivity of screening. The effects on cancer detection rates and breast cancers and total mortality was studied for a cohort of women followed from age 45 to age 89. RESULTS: Running the model from age 45 to 89, with sensitivity set at the baseline value of 75%, predicts the detection at screening of 44 cancers per thousand of population and the detection outside screening of 82 cancers per thousand of population. Running the model with values of sensitivity from 75% to 95% shows the proportion of cancers detected at screening increasing as screening improves, and deaths from breast cancer falling. The drop in breast cancer deaths is however modest. Increasing sensitivity from 75% to 85% reduces the number of breast cancer deaths from 28 to 27 per thousand. CONCLUSIONS: Likely achievable improvements in the sensitivity of screening do not have a marked effect on breast cancer mortality.;J Med Screen. 2010.17(1):31-6. doi: 10.1258/jms.2009.009048.;Taylor P1.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Early Detection of Cancer/statistics & numerical data*,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,United Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Modelling the future costs of breast screening.;Abstract The aim of this paper was to estimate the future breast cancer and non-breast cancer costs associated with breast screening. The Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) was used to stratify patients into different prognostic groups and to predict the impact of breast screening on future costs. A Markov model was used to estimate breast cancer and non-breast costs for each prognostic group. Breast cancer costs were found to increase as the severity of prognosis increases. The opposite pattern was found for non-breast cancer costs. The total future costs (breast cancer and non-breast cancer costs) for each prognostic group was between pound10000 and pound11000. As a percentage of the costs of screening, the savings in future breast cancer costs were 20.9%. Inclusion of non-breast cancer costs cancelled out any potential savings in future breast cancer cost resulting from a better prognosis and resulted in an increase of 5.7% in future costs. Whether to include the latter type of cost remains a methodological issue of debate in economic evaluation.;Eur J Cancer. 2001 Sep.37(14):1752-8.;Johnston K1.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Cost of Illness,England,Female,Health Care Costs/trends*,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Prognosis,Recurrence,Severity of Illness Index;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1;Modelling the effect of breast cancer screening on related mortality using French data.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: This study aimed at modelling the effect of organized breast cancer screening on mortality in France. It combined results from a Markov model for breast cancer progression, to predict number of cases by node status, and from relative survival analyses, to predict deaths. The method estimated the relative risk of mortality at 8 years, in women aged 50-69, between a population screened every two years and a reference population. METHODS: Analyses concerned cases diagnosed between 1990 and 1996, with a follow-up up to 2004 for the vital status. Markov models analysed data from 3 screening programs (300,000 mammographies) and took into account opportunistic screening among participants to avoid bias in parameter's estimates. We used survival data from cancers in the general population (n=918, 7 cancer registries) and from screened cancers (n=565, 3 cancer registries), after excluding a subgroup of screened cases with a particularly high survival. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Markov model main analysis lacked of fit in two out of three districts. Fit was improved in stratified analyses by age or district, though some lack of fit persisted in two districts. Assuming 10% or 20% overdiagnosed screened cancers, mortality reduction was estimated as 23% (95% CI: 4, 38%) and 19% (CI: -3, 35%) respectively. Results were highly sensitive to the exclusion in the screened cancers survival analysis. Conversely, RR estimates varied moderately according to the Markov model parameters used (stratified by age or district). CONCLUSION: The study aimed at estimating the effect of screening in a screened population compared to an unscreened control group. Such a control group does not exist in France, and we used a general population contaminated by opportunistic screening to provide a conservative estimate. Conservative choices were systematically adopted to avoid favourable estimates. A selection bias might however affect the estimates, though it should be moderate because extreme social classes are under-represented among participants. This modelling provided broad estimates for the effect of organized biennial screening in France in the early nineteen-nineties. Results will be strengthened with longer follow-up.

1;Modelling future capacity needs and spending on colonoscopy in the English bowel cancer screening programme.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Bowel cancer screening using faecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy is currently being rolled out across England. Guidelines recommend that people identified by colonoscopy as having intermediate- or high-risk bowel polyps be offered periodic surveillance colonoscopy because of their elevated risk of bowel cancer. We make projections of the likely year-on-year increase in volumes and spending on colonoscopy due to the screening and surveillance programmes. METHODS: We constructed a model based on current bowel cancer screening and surveillance guidelines using screening outcome measures taken from the second round of the English bowel screening pilot. This was then used to predict colonoscopy volumes and cost for a hypothetical population. RESULTS: For a hypothetical population of 500,000 people, with average deprivation and 66,956 subjects aged 60-74 years, the initial screening and surveillance round would be expected to detect 34 cancers at a cost of 394,157 pounds sterling. In the first 8 years, colonoscopy numbers will grow at a rate of 23 per year, most of which will be surveillance colonoscopies. Colonoscopy costs may grow by 11,808 pounds sterling yearly in the same period, representing a cost per eligible person of 2.86 pounds sterling initially, increasing by 0.13 pounds sterling every year. Sensitivity analyses suggest significant changes in these predictions if screening uptake changes by 20%. CONCLUSION: The model has been used to make projections for five primary care trusts within the South Central Strategic Health Authority. Results from the volume and cost projections can inform service planning and resource allocation at local levels for the implementation of the current and future bowel cancer screening programme.;Gut. 2008 Sep.57(9):1238-45. doi: 10.1136/gut.2007.146050.

0;Modeling the time dependence of the association between human papillomavirus infection and cervical cancer precursor lesions.;Abstract The authors studied the time-dependent association between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) among women enrolled in a cohort study in Brazil (1993-2002), using repeated Papanicolaou cytologic examination and HPV testing by polymerase chain reaction. Through simulation with conceivable alternative cohort designs, they investigated different regression modeling approaches using time-varying covariates, time-varying hazard ratio functions, and repeated events to assess the effect of delay in lesion detection. Associations between HPV and early SIL were of high magnitude. The age-adjusted hazard ratios for the association between HPV at enrollment and low-grade SIL decreased gradually with time until 72 months for both oncogenic types of HPV (hazard ratio = 3.96, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5, 6.4) and nononcogenic types (hazard ratio = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.3, 4.3). The hazard ratio for incident high-grade SIL remained constant, ranging from 7.15 (95% CI: 2.0, 25.1) at 12 months to 6.26 (95% CI: 2.7, 14.5) at 72 months for oncogenic types of HPV. With oncogenic HPV as the time-dependent predictor variable, the hazard ratios for incident SIL and high-grade SIL events were 14.2 (95% CI: 8.7, 23.1) and 32.7 (95% CI: 8.4, 127.3), respectively. Investigators may underestimate the prognostic value of HPV detection using designs that rely on HPV ascertainment at a single time point. The waning in hazard ratios should be considered in the implementation of HPV testing-based screening programs.;Am J Epidemiol. 2003 Nov 1.158(9):878-86.;Schlecht NF1, Platt RW, Negassa A, Duarte-Franco E, Rohan TE, Ferenczy A, Villa LL, Franco EL.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Brazil/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Papanicolaou Test,Papillomavirus Infections/complications*,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Precancerous Conditions/diagnosis,Precancerous Conditions/epidemiology,Precancerous Conditions/virology*,Proportional Hazards Models,Regression Analysis,Time Factors,Tumor Virus Infections/complications*,Tumor Virus Infections/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology*,Vaginal Smears,CA70269/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,MA13647/PHS HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Modeling the impact of the decline in distant stage disease on prostate carcinoma mortality rates.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The incidence of distant stage prostate carcinoma was relatively flat until 1991 and then started declining rapidly. This decline probably was caused by the shift to earlier stage disease associated with the rapid dissemination of prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening. Prostate carcinoma mortality rates started falling at approximately the same time. In this article, the authors model the potential impact of this stage shift on prostate carcinoma mortality rates given various assumptions concerning the survival of patients with screen-detected local-regional disease. METHODS: The authors used the CAN*TROL 2 computer model to shift each deficit in the number of patients with distant stage disease to local-regional stage disease and modeled the implications on mortality using a set of base, optimistic, and pessimistic survival assumptions. A base survival assumes that a patient with screen-detected local-regional disease of a certain histologic grade has the same prognosis as a patient with clinically detected local-regional disease of same grade (i.e., an assumption of no length bias for patients with screen-detected disease), whereas the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios assume that survival is better or worse, respectively, than the base survival (i.e., complete cure for patients with favorable grade for the optimistic scenario and no improvements in survival for patients with unfavorable grade for the pessimistic scenario). RESULTS: Model results were compared with observed mortality trends. Rising age-adjusted mortality rates peaked in 1991 for white males and in 1993 for black males and then fell 21% and 13% for white males and black males, respectively, from 1990 through 1999. Under the modeled stage-shift intervention, mortality rates would fall 18%, 8%, and 19% for both white males and black males under the base, pessimistic, and optimistic assumptions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: It is impossible to know what the mortality trends would have been in the absence of the introduction of PSA screening. However, under the base assumption, it appears that the decline in distant stage disease can have a fairly sizable and rapid impact on population mortality. The optimistic scenario is not much improved over the base scenario, which is indicative of the facts that the survival of patients diagnosed with clinical local-regional prostate carcinoma is quite good and that further survival improvements can have only a marginal impact. Under the pessimistic scenario, it appears that something else must be responsible for much of the decline in mortality. Screening trial results from the United States and Europe may verify and isolate the size of any mortality benefit associated with PSA screening. Trial results eventually can be put back into these population models to help quantify the impact of screening, treatment, and other factors on population trends.;Cancer. 2002 Aug 15.95(4):870-80.;Feuer EJ1, Mariotto A, Merrill R.;Computer Simulation*,Humans,Male,Mortality/trends,Neoplasm Staging,Prostate-Specific Antigen/analysis,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality*,Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology,Survival Analysis,Time Factors,Prostate-Specific Antigen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Modeling the Cost-Effectiveness of Alternative Upper Age Limits for Breast Cancer Screening in England and Wales.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Currently in the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) Breast Screening Programme invites all women for triennial mammography between the ages of 47 and 73 years (the extension to 47-50 and 70-73 years is currently examined as part of a randomized controlled trial). The benefits and harms of screening in women 70 years and older, however, are less well documented. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether extending screening to women older than 70 years would represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources and to identify the upper age limit at which screening mammography should be extended in England and Wales. METHODS: A mathematical model that allows the impact of screening policies on cancer diagnosis and subsequent management to be assessed was built. The model has two parts: a natural history model of the progression of breast cancer up to discovery and a postdiagnosis model of treatment, recurrence, and survival. The natural history model was calibrated to available data and compared against published literature. The management of breast cancer at diagnosis was taken from registry data and valued using official UK tariffs. RESULTS: The model estimated that screening would lead to overdiagnosis in 6.2% of screen-detected women at the age of 72 years, increasing up to 37.9% at the age of 90 years. Under commonly quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds in the United Kingdom, our study suggests that an extension to screening up to the age of 78 years represents a cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides encouraging findings to support the extension of the screening program to older ages and suggests that further extension of the UK NHS Breast Screening Programme up to age 78 years beyond the current upper age limit of 73 years could be potentially cost-effective according to current NHS willingness-to-pay thresholds.

0;Modeling joint exposures and health outcomes for cumulative risk assessment: the case of radon and smoking.;Abstract Community-based cumulative risk assessment requires characterization of exposures to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors, with consideration of how the non-chemical stressors may influence risks from chemical stressors. Residential radon provides an interesting case example, given its large attributable risk, effect modification due to smoking, and significant variability in radon concentrations and smoking patterns. In spite of this fact, no study to date has estimated geographic and sociodemographic patterns of both radon and smoking in a manner that would allow for inclusion of radon in community-based cumulative risk assessment. In this study, we apply multi-level regression models to explain variability in radon based on housing characteristics and geological variables, and construct a regression model predicting housing characteristics using U.S. Census data. Multi-level regression models of smoking based on predictors common to the housing model allow us to link the exposures. We estimate county-average lifetime lung cancer risks from radon ranging from 0.15 to 1.8 in 100, with high-risk clusters in areas and for subpopulations with high predicted radon and smoking rates. Our findings demonstrate the viability of screening-level assessment to characterize patterns of lung cancer risk from radon, with an approach that can be generalized to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors.;Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2011 Sep.8(9):3688-711. doi: 10.3390/ijerph8093688.

0;Modeling and development of screen-printed impedance biosensor for cytotoxicity studies of lung carcinoma cells.;Abstract Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is a powerful technique to monitor real-time cell behavior. In this study, an ECIS biosensor formed using two interdigitated electrode structures (IDEs) was used to monitor cell behavior and its response to toxicants. Three different sensors with varied electrode spacing were first modeled using COMSOL Multiphysics and then fabricated and tested. The silver/silver chloride IDEs were fabricated using a screen-printing technique and incorporated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cell culture wells. To study the effectiveness of the biosensor, A549 lung carcinoma cells were seeded in the culture wells together with collagen as an extracellular matrix (ECM) to promote cell attachment on electrodes. A549 cells were cultured in the chambers and impedance measurements were taken at 12-h intervals for 120 h. Cell index (CI) for both designs were calculated from the impedance measurement and plotted in comparison with the growth profile of the cells in T-flasks. To verify that the ECIS biosensor can also be used to study cell response to toxicants, the A549 cells were also treated with anti-cancer drug, paclitaxel, and its responses were monitored over 5 days. Both simulation and experimental results show better sensitivity for smaller spacing between electrodes.

1;Model building on the basis of Dutch cervical cancer screening data.;Abstract A mass screening programme for cervical cancer is in progress in three pilot regions in The Netherlands. All women living in these regions aged 35-53 are invited to undergo screening at three-year intervals. The MISCAN simulation model was developed for the analysis and optimization of screening programmes. In this paper the model-based approach to evaluation is first outlined and then illustrated by analysing data from the first two screening rounds in the pilot regions. This analysis resulted in a rather restricted range of data-compatible assumptions for the mean duration of preclinical disease (14-19 yr) and the frequency of spontaneous regression of preinvasive lesions (45-65%), as well as a rather wide sensitivity range for the Pap smear (50-90%). These preliminary findings are compared with those of a previous MISCAN analysis of cervical cancer screening in British Columbia. On the basis of an assumed 18-yr duration, 50% regression and 70% sensitivity, a number of screening policies relating to the same age ranges but with different intervals are compared. Both the analysis and the policy comparisons are preliminary, but the findings are nevertheless reasonable and consistent with those of previous studies. A more complete MISCAN-based analysis of the Dutch screening programme and subsequent optimization of screening policies will be possible when further results become available and a cost-effectiveness analysis procedure has been incorporated into the MISCAN programme.;Maturitas. 1985 May.7(1):11-20.;Habbema JD, van Oortmarssen GJ, Lubbe JT, van der Maas PJ.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Female,Humans,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Netherlands,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;MLE and Bayesian inference of age-dependent sensitivity and transition probability in periodic screening.;Abstract This article extends previous probability models for periodic breast cancer screening examinations. The specific aim is to provide statistical inference for age dependence of sensitivity and the transition probability from the disease free to the preclinical state. The setting is a periodic screening program in which a cohort of initially asymptomatic women undergo a sequence of breast cancer screening exams. We use age as a covariate in the estimation of screening sensitivity and the transition probability simultaneously, both from a frequentist point of view and within a Bayesian framework. We apply our method to the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York study of female breast cancer and give age-dependent sensitivity and transition probability density estimates. The inferential methodology we develop is also applicable when analyzing studies of modalities for early detection of other types of progressive chronic diseases.;Biometrics. 2005 Dec.61(4):1056-63.;Wu D1, Rosner GL, Broemeling L.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Age Factors,Bayes Theorem*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Female,Humans,Likelihood Functions*,Mammography/methods,Mammography/standards,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/standards,Middle Aged,Sensitivity and Specificity,R01 CA079466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R03 CA115012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,CA-79466/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Method of detection and breast cancer survival disparities in Hispanic women.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Hispanic women in New Mexico (NM) are more likely than non-Hispanic women to die of breast cancer-related causes. We determined whether survival differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic women might be attributable to the method of detection, an independent breast cancer prognostic factor in previous studies. METHODS: White women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from 1995 through 2004 were identified from NM Surveillance Epidemiology End Results (SEER) files (n = 5,067) and matched to NM Mammography Project records. Method of cancer detection was categorized as symptomatic or screen-detected. The proportion of Hispanic survival disparity accounted for by included variables was assessed using Cox models. RESULTS: In the median follow-up of 87 months, 490 breast cancer deaths occurred. Symptomatic versus screen-detection was classifiable for 3,891 women (76.8%), and was independently related to breast cancer-specific survival [hazard ratio (HR), 1.6. 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.3-2.0]. Hispanic women had a 1.5-fold increased risk of breast cancer-related death, relative to non-Hispanic women (95% CI, 1.2-1.8). After adjustment for detection method, the Hispanic HR declined from 1.50 to 1.45 (10%), but after inclusion of other prognostic indicators the Hispanic HR equaled 1.23 (95% CI, 1.01-1.48). CONCLUSIONS: Although the Hispanic HR declined 50% after adjustment, the decrease was largely due to adverse tumor prognostic characteristics. IMPACT: Reduction of disparate survival in Hispanic women may rely not only on increased detection of tumors when asymptomatic but on the development of greater understanding of biological factors that predispose to poor prognosis tumors. ©2010 AACR.;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2010 Oct.19(10):2453-60. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0164.

0;Menopausal hormone replacement therapy and risk of ovarian cancer.;Abstract CONTEXT: The association between menopausal hormone replacement therapy and ovarian cancer is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hormone replacement therapy using estrogen only, estrogen-progestin only, or both estrogen only and estrogen-progestin increases ovarian cancer risk. DESIGN: A 1979-1998 cohort study of former participants in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project, a nationwide breast cancer screening program. SETTING: Twenty-nine US clinical centers. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 44 241 postmenopausal women (mean age at start of follow-up, 56.6 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident ovarian cancer. RESULTS: We identified 329 women who developed ovarian cancer during follow-up. In time-dependent analyses adjusted for age, menopause type, and oral contraceptive use, ever use of estrogen only was significantly associated with ovarian cancer (rate ratio [RR], 1.6. 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.0). Increasing duration of estrogen-only use was significantly associated with ovarian cancer: RRs for 10 to 19 years and 20 or more years were 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-3.0) and 3.2 (95% CI, 1.7-5.7), respectively (P value for trend <.001), and we observed a 7% (95% CI, 2%-13%) increase in RR per year of use. We observed significantly elevated RRs with increasing duration of estrogen-only use across all strata of other ovarian cancer risk factors, including women with hysterectomy. The RR for estrogen-progestin use after prior estrogen-only use was 1.5 (95% CI, 0.91-2.4), but the RR for estrogen-progestin-only use was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.64-1.7). The RRs for less than 2 years and 2 or more years of estrogen-progestin-only use were 1.6 (95% CI, 0.78-3.3) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.35-1.8), respectively, and there was no evidence of a duration response (P value for trend =.30). CONCLUSION: Women who used estrogen-only replacement therapy, particularly for 10 or more years, were at significantly increased risk of ovarian cancer in this study. Women who used short-term estrogen-progestin-only replacement therapy were not at increased risk, but risk associated with short-term and longer-term estrogen-progestin replacement therapy warrants further investigation.;JAMA. 2002 Jul 17.288(3):334-41.;Lacey JV Jr1, Mink PJ, Lubin JH, Sherman ME, Troisi R, Hartge P, Schatzkin A, Schairer C.;Multicenter Study,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Aged,Estrogen Replacement Therapy*,Estrogens/therapeutic use,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Hysterectomy,Likelihood Functions,Middle Aged,Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Poisson Distribution,Progestins/therapeutic use,Risk,Time Factors,Estrogens,Progestins;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Meditative Movement Therapies and Health-Related Quality-of-Life in Adults: A Systematic Review of Meta-Analyses.;Abstract Poor health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) is a significant public health issue while the use of meditative movement therapies has been increasing. The purpose of this investigation was to carry out a systematic review of previous meta-analyses that examined the effects of meditative movement therapies (yoga, tai chi and qigong) on HRQOL in adults. Previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials published up through February, 2014 were included by searching nine electronic databases and cross-referencing. Dual-selection and data abstraction occurred. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews Instrument (AMSTAR) was used to assess methodological quality. Standardized mean differences that were pooled using random-effects models were included. In addition, 95% prediction intervals were calculated as well as the number needed-to-treat and percentile improvements. Of the 510 citations screened, 10 meta-analyses representing a median of 3 standardized mean differences in 82 to 528 participants (median = 270) with breast cancer, schizophrenia, low back pain, heart failure and diabetes, were included. Median methodological quality was 70%. Median length, frequency and duration of the meditative movement therapies were 12 weeks, 3 times per week, for 71 minutes per session. The majority of results (78.9%) favored statistically significant improvements (non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals) in HRQOL, with standardized mean differences ranging from 0.18 to 2.28. More than half of the results yielded statistically significant heterogeneity (Q ≤ 0.10) and large or very large inconsistency (I2 ≥ 50%). All 95% prediction intervals included zero. The number-needed-to-treat ranged from 2 to 10 while percentile improvements ranged from 9.9 to 48.9. The results of this study suggest that meditative movement therapies may improve HRQOL in adults with selected conditions. However, a need exists for a large, more inclusive meta-analysis (PROSPERO Registration #CRD42014014576).;PLoS One. 2015 Jun 8.10(6):e0129181. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0129181. eCollection 2015.;Kelley GA1, Kelley KS1.;Meta-Analysis,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Review,Adult,Exercise Therapy*/methods,Humans,Meditation*,Models, Statistical,Public Health Surveillance,Quality of Life*,U54 GM104942/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States,U54GM104942/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Measuring screening intensity in case-control studies of the efficacy of mammography.;Abstract Of great interest in studies of screening for breast cancer is the relative efficacy of different screening frequencies (intensities). Prior work has suggested that estimates of the association between screening intensity and outcome in case-control studies would not produce valid results and that only binary indicators (no screens vs. one or more) of exposure can be used. Using case-control studies drawn from simulated cohorts of 30,000-40,000 women, the authors found that biases demonstrated in prior studies can be explained by 1) misclassification of true exposure groups by observed screening history, and 2) differential exposure misclassification of cases and controls. Binary as well as ordered categorical and interval measures can be biased unless they account for misclassification. By combining measurements of screening history from multiple periods of observation of varying lengths and using repeated-measures logistic regression models, the effect of screening intensity can be estimated in the presence of misclassification. Assessing the effect of screening intensity in case-control studies of mammography is possible if principles and methods for misclassification and measurement error guide the analysis.;Am J Epidemiol. 2006 Aug 1.164(3):272-81.

0;Mass screening for rectal neoplasm in Jiashan County, China.;Abstract Jiashan county is a rural area in China with very high incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer. From 1980 to 1984, we conducted a mass screening for rectal neoplasm in the 11 people's communes in this county. Of the 72,879 individuals who were eligible for screening, 60,496 participated, representing an overall participation rate of 83.0%. Both the fecal occult blood (OB) test and rectoscopy were performed on 47,560 of the participants, and rectoscopy only was performed on the remaining 12,936 individuals. From the mass screening, 15 rectal cancers, 3 carcinoids, 899 polyps, 98 ulcers, and 7 inflammatory tumors were detected, a total of 1022 cases. Eight of the 15 detected cases of rectal cancer were in Dukes' stage A. We did not find any evidence for an association between schistosomiasis and colorectal cancer. Results from the OB test were found to have a negative correlation with results from rectoscopy (odds ratio = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.6, 1.1). The OB test had a high false positive rate of 32.7%, and a poor positive predictive value of 3.5%. Both its positive and negative predictive powers were below 1.0, in other words, its positive likelihood ratio was below 1.0 and negative likelihood ratio was above 1.0, indicating that the OB test is not informative and has a poor predictive accuracy for rectal neoplasm. In addition, there were a number of practical problems concerning the use of the OB test for mass screening in the rural community.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).;J Clin Epidemiol. 1991.44(12):1379-85.;Zheng GM1, Choi BC, Yu XR, Zou RB, Shao YW, Ma XY.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,China/epidemiology,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology,Evaluation Studies as Topic,Humans,Incidence,Likelihood Functions,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/standards,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Occult Blood,Predictive Value of Tests,Prevalence,Rural Population,Sigmoidoscopy/standards;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Management of prostate cancer in older men: recommendations of a working group of the International Society of Geriatric Oncology.;Abstract Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men and predominantly affects older men (aged >or=70 years). The median age at diagnosis is 68 years. overall, two-thirds of prostate cancer-related deaths occur in men aged >or=75 years. With the exponential ageing of the population and the increasing life-expectancy in developed countries, the burden of prostate cancer is expected to increase dramatically in the future. To date, no specific guidelines on the management of prostate cancer in older men have been published. The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) conducted a systematic bibliographic search based on screening, diagnostic procedures and treatment options for localized and advanced prostate cancer, to develop a proposal for recommendations that should provide the highest standard of care for older men with prostate cancer. The consensus of the SIOG Prostate Cancer Task Force is that older men with prostate cancer should be managed according to their individual health status, which is mainly driven by the severity of associated comorbid conditions, and not according to chronological age. Existing international recommendations (European Association of Urology, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Urological Association) are the backbone for localized and advanced prostate cancer treatment, but need to be adapted to patient health status. Based on a rapid and simple evaluation, patients can be classified into four different groups: 1, 'Healthy' patients (controlled comorbidity, fully independent in daily living activities, no malnutrition) should receive the same treatment as younger patients. 2, 'Vulnerable' patients (reversible impairment) should receive standard treatment after medical intervention. 3, 'Frail' patients (irreversible impairment) should receive adapted treatment. 4, Patients who are 'too sick' with 'terminal illness' should receive only symptomatic palliative treatment.;BJU Int. 2010 Aug.106(4):462-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2010.09334.x.

0;Machine learning models in breast cancer survival prediction.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers with a high mortality rate among women. With the early diagnosis of breast cancer survival will increase from 56% to more than 86%. Therefore, an accurate and reliable system is necessary for the early diagnosis of this cancer. The proposed model is the combination of rules and different machine learning techniques. Machine learning models can help physicians to reduce the number of false decisions. They try to exploit patterns and relationships among a large number of cases and predict the outcome of a disease using historical cases stored in datasets. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to propose a rule-based classification method with machine learning techniques for the prediction of different types of Breast cancer survival. METHODS: We use a dataset with eight attributes that include the records of 900 patients in which 876 patients (97.3%) and 24 (2.7%) patients were females and males respectively. Naive Bayes (NB), Trees Random Forest (TRF), 1-Nearest Neighbor (1NN), AdaBoost (AD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), RBF Network (RBFN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) machine learning techniques with 10-cross fold technique were used with the proposed model for the prediction of breast cancer survival. The performance of machine learning techniques were evaluated with accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under ROC curve. RESULTS: Out of 900 patients, 803 patients and 97 patients were alive and dead, respectively. In this study, Trees Random Forest (TRF) technique showed better results in comparison to other techniques (NB, 1NN, AD, SVM and RBFN, MLP). The accuracy, sensitivity and the area under ROC curve of TRF are 96%, 96%, 93%, respectively. However, 1NN machine learning technique provided poor performance (accuracy 91%, sensitivity 91% and area under ROC curve 78%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Trees Random Forest model (TRF) which is a rule-based classification model was the best model with the highest level of accuracy. Therefore, this model is recommended as a useful tool for breast cancer survival prediction as well as medical decision making.;Technol Health Care. 2016.24(1):31-42. doi: 10.3233/THC-151071.;Montazeri M1,2, Montazeri M3,4, Montazeri M5, Beigzadeh A6.;Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/classification*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods*,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Humans,Machine Learning*,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Predictive Value of Tests*,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,Survival Rate*,Young Adult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

0;Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Model Incorporating Lung Function: Development and Validation in the UK Biobank Prospective Cohort Study.;Abstract Purpose Several lung cancer risk prediction models have been developed, but none to date have assessed the predictive ability of lung function in a population-based cohort. We sought to develop and internally validate a model incorporating lung function using data from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study. Methods This analysis included 502,321 participants without a previous diagnosis of lung cancer, predominantly between 40 and 70 years of age. We used flexible parametric survival models to estimate the 2-year probability of lung cancer, accounting for the competing risk of death. Models included predictors previously shown to be associated with lung cancer risk, including sex, variables related to smoking history and nicotine addiction, medical history, family history of lung cancer, and lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]). Results During accumulated follow-up of 1,469,518 person-years, there were 738 lung cancer diagnoses. A model incorporating all predictors had excellent discrimination (concordance (c)-statistic [95% CI] = 0.85 [0.82 to 0.87]). Internal validation suggested that the model will discriminate well when applied to new data (optimism-corrected c-statistic = 0.84). The full model, including FEV1, also had modestly superior discriminatory power than one that was designed solely on the basis of questionnaire variables (c-statistic = 0.84 [0.82 to 0.86]. optimism-corrected c-statistic = 0.83. pFEV1 = 3.4 × 10-13). The full model had better discrimination than standard lung cancer screening eligibility criteria (c-statistic = 0.66 [0.64 to 0.69]). Conclusion A risk prediction model that includes lung function has strong predictive ability, which could improve eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening programs.;J Clin Oncol. 2017 Mar 10.35(8):861-869. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2016.69.2467.

0;Long-term follow-up of cervical disease in women screened by cytology and HPV testing: results from the HART study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types results in an improved sensitivity for CIN2+, compared with cytology, although with a somewhat lower specificity. METHODS: We obtained follow-up results, with at least one smear after participation in the HART study, which compared HPV testing (HC-II) with cytology as a primary screening modality. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6 years, 42 additional cases of CIN2+ were identified. women who were HPV positive at baseline were more likely to develop CIN2+ than those who were HPV negative (hazard ratio (HR) 17.2. 95% confidence interval (CI) (9.3-31.6)) and the risk increased with increasing viral load. Compared with HPV-negative women (relative light unit (RLU) <1), the HR (95% CI) was 5.4 (1.6, 18.2) for 1-10 RLU and 25.5 (13.6, 47.9) for RLU > or = 10. Positive cytology (borderline or worse compared with negative) was also predictive of developing CIN2, although to a lesser extent (HR 8.7. 95% CI (4.5-17.1)). Only one case of CIN3 and three cases of CIN2 were found in women who showed a positive cytology result but were HPV negative at baseline. CONCLUSION: After 5 years of follow-up, CIN2+ occurred in 0.23% of women who were HPV negative at baseline compared with 0.48% of women who showed a negative cytology result, indicating a much longer low-risk interval for CIN2+ after HPV testing.;Br J Cancer. 2010 Apr 27.102(9):1405-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605619.

0;Lifetime socioeconomic position and mortality: prospective observational study.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of socioeconomic position over a lifetime on risk factors for cardiovascular disease, on morbidity, and on mortality from various causes. DESIGN: Prospective observational study with 21 years of follow up. Social class was determined as manual or non-manual at three stages of participants' lives: from the social class of their father's job, the social class of their first job, and the social class of their job at the time of screening. A cumulative social class indicator was constructed, ranging from non-manual social class at all three stages of life to manual social class at all three stages. SETTING: 27 workplaces in the west of Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 5766 men aged 35-64 at the time of examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and level of risk factors for cardiovascular disease. morbidity. and mortality from broad causes of death. RESULTS: From non-manual social class locations at all three life stages to manual at all stages there were strong positive trends for blood pressure, body mass index, current cigarette smoking, angina, and bronchitis. Inverse trends were seen for height, cholesterol concentration, lung function, and being an ex-smoker. 1580 men died during follow up. Age adjusted relative death rates in comparison with the men of non-manual social class locations at all three stages of life were 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.56) in men of two non-manual and one manual social class. 1.45 (1.21 to 1.73) in men of two manual and one non-manual social class. and 1.71 (1.46 to 2.01) in men of manual social class at all three stages. Mortality from cardiovascular disease showed a similar graded association with cumulative social class. Mortality from cancer was mainly raised among men of manual social class at all three stages. Adjustment for a wide range of risk factors caused little attenuation in the association of cumulative social class with mortality from all causes and from cardiovascular disease. greater attenuation was seen in the association with mortality from non-cardiovascular, non-cancer disease. Fathers having a manual [corrected] occupation was strongly associated with mortality from cardiovascular disease: relative rate 1.41 (1.15 to 1.72). Participants' social class at the time of screening was more strongly associated than the other social class indicators with mortality from cancer and from non-cardiovascular, non-cancer causes. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic factors acting over the lifetime affect health and risk of premature death. The relative importance of influences at different stages varies for the cause of death. Studies with data on socioeconomic circumstances at only one stage of life are inadequate for fully elucidating the contribution of socioeconomic factors to health and mortality risk.;BMJ. 1997 Feb 22.314(7080):547-52.;Smith GD1, Hart C, Blane D, Gillis C, Hawthorne V.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality*,Cause of Death,Cohort Studies,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Prevalence,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Risk Factors,Scotland/epidemiology,Social Class*,Socioeconomic Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Life expectancy and the value of early detection.;Abstract This paper presents a model of the benefits and costs of early detection of asymptomatic disease as they vary by age. The benefits of early detection tend toward zero as the risk of death from competing causes increases. Costs per detected case also decline with age, assuming that disease incidence rises with age, but are always strictly positive. On balance, there is always an age limit beyond which the costs associated with early detection outweigh the benefits. Application of the model to prostate cancer screening suggests that early detection above age 70 or so is not cost-effective.;J Health Econ. 2005 Sep.24(5):891-906.

0;League tables of breast cancer screening units: worst-case and best-case scenario ratings helped in exposing real differences between performance ratings.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Data on the performance of health boards, hospitals and medical specialists, etc., are being collected at various levels in the health-care system and are often presented as league tables. These tables ignore natural variation and/or confounders, and this introduces uncertainty about their interpretation. The purpose of this study was to devise and illustrate a method to expose the real difference between the ratings in league tables. METHODS: Two values per rating were added to the league tables: the best-case scenario and the worst-case scenario. True performance will lie somewhere between these two values. The method is illustrated using data from the Dutch breast cancer screening programme. RESULTS: By focusing on one performance indicator and one confounder, it was possible to show shifts in the rating order of breast cancer screening units and thus expose the uncertainty about the true performance of each screening unit. CONCLUSIONS: The worst-case and best-case scenario ratings demonstrated the uncertainty within the ratings of a league table. League tables should therefore only be used with great caution and after providing the public with sufficient information.;J Med Screen. 2009.16(2):67-72. doi: 10.1258/jms.2009.008093.;Lemmers O1, Broeders M, Verbeek A, Heeten Gd, Holland R, Borm GF.;Age Factors,Aged,Benchmarking,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Delivery of Health Care,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric,Public Health Administration,Quality Assurance, Health Care,Quality of Health Care,Uncertainty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

KM is a cyclical process which typically starts with knowledge creation (KC), progresses to knowledge sharing, knowledge accessibility and eventually results in new KC (in the same or a related domain). KC plays a significant role in KM as it creates the necessary seeds for propagating many more knowledge cycles. This paper addresses the potential of KC in the context of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) breast screening service. KC can be automated to a greater extent by embedding processes within an artificial intelligence (AI) based environment. The UK breast screening service is concerned about non-attendance and this paper discusses issues pertaining to increasing attendance.;Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2006.1:4070-3.;Baskaran V1, Bali RK, Arochena H, Naguib RN, Wallis M, Wheaton M.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Artificial Intelligence*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Female,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice,Humans,Knowledge,Mass Screening/methods*,State Medicine,United Kingdom/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Investigation of estrogen receptor (ESR1) for breast cancer from traditional Chinese medicine.;Abstract Recently, an important topic of breast cancer had been published in 2013. In this report, estrogen receptor (ESR1) had defined the relation of hormone-cause breast cancer. The screening of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database has found the molecular compounds by simulating molecular docking and molecular dynamics to regulate ESR1. S-Allylmercaptocysteine and 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan are selected according to the highest docking score than that of other TCM compounds and Raloxifene (control). The simulation from molecular dynamics is helpful in analyzing and detecting the protein-ligand interactions. After a comparing the control and the Apo form, then based on the docking poses, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bond and structure variations, this research postulates that S-allylmercaptocysteine may be more appropriate than other compounds for protein-ligand interaction.;Biomed Res Int. 2014.2014:321486. doi: 10.1155/2014/321486.

0;Interpreting overdiagnosis estimates in population-based mammography screening.;Abstract Estimates of overdiagnosis in mammography screening range from 1% to 54%. This review explains such variations using gradual implementation of mammography screening in the Netherlands as an example. Breast cancer incidence without screening was predicted with a micro-simulation model. Observed breast cancer incidence (including ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer) was modeled and compared with predicted incidence without screening during various phases of screening program implementation. Overdiagnosis was calculated as the difference between the modeled number of breast cancers with and the predicted number of breast cancers without screening. Estimating overdiagnosis annually between 1990 and 2006 illustrated the importance of the time at which overdiagnosis is measured. Overdiagnosis was also calculated using several estimators identified from the literature. The estimated overdiagnosis rate peaked during the implementation phase of screening, at 11.4% of all predicted cancers in women aged 0-100 years in the absence of screening. At steady-state screening, in 2006, this estimate had decreased to 2.8%. When different estimators were used, the overdiagnosis rate in 2006 ranged from 3.6% (screening age or older) to 9.7% (screening age only). The authors concluded that the estimated overdiagnosis rate in 2006 could vary by a factor of 3.5 when different denominators were used. Calculations based on earlier screening program phases may overestimate overdiagnosis by a factor 4. Sufficient follow-up and agreement regarding the chosen estimator are needed to obtain reliable estimates.;Epidemiol Rev. 2011.33:111-21. doi: 10.1093/epirev/mxr009.

0;Interhospital differences in cancer survivals in Japan. The Research Group for Population-based Cancer Registration in Japan.;Abstract The present study was an investigation of variations in cancer survival rates among hospitals in Japan, focusing in particular on the number of hospital beds as an institutional characteristic. Using data from 11 population-based cancer registries, the three-year survival rates for stomach cancer (n 1665), colorectal cancer (n 1090) and lung cancer (n 895) patients diagnosed in 1985 were calculated according to three different hospital categories (100-299, 300-499, 500+ beds). Cox's proportional hazards model was conducted, with adjustments for sex, age, clinical stage at diagnosis and treatment status, excluding patients who had been detected by screening (asymptomatic cases). The stomach and lung cancer patients treated in small hospitals (100-299 beds) were at a significantly higher risk of death than those treated in large hospitals (500+ beds) (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.11-1.65. HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.13-1.77, respectively). Similar findings were observed among colorectal cancer patients although they were not statistically significant. The findings can provide some information useful for the development of future public health policies aimed at controlling cancer mortality rates in our country.;Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jun.23(3):191-8.;Tanaka H1, Hiyama T, Hanai A, Fujimoto I.;Adult,Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality*,Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology,Female,Hospital Bed Capacity,Hospital Mortality*,Humans,Japan/epidemiology,Lung Neoplasms/mortality*,Lung Neoplasms/pathology,Male,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Proportional Hazards Models,Registries,Regression Analysis,Risk,Stomach Neoplasms/mortality*,Stomach Neoplasms/pathology,Survival Rate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Integration of architectural and cytologic driven image algorithms for prostate adenocarcinoma identification.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: The advent of digital slides offers new opportunities within the practice of pathology such as the use of image analysis techniques to facilitate computer aided diagnosis (CAD) solutions. Use of CAD holds promise to enable new levels of decision support and allow for additional layers of quality assurance and consistency in rendered diagnoses. However, the development and testing of prostate cancer CAD solutions requires a ground truth map of the cancer to enable the generation of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. This requires a pathologist to annotate, or paint, each of the malignant glands in prostate cancer with an image editor software - a time consuming and exhaustive process. Recently, two CAD algorithms have been described: probabilistic pairwise Markov models (PPMM) and spatially-invariant vector quantization (SIVQ). Briefly, SIVQ operates as a highly sensitive and specific pattern matching algorithm, making it optimal for the identification of any epithelial morphology, whereas PPMM operates as a highly sensitive detector of malignant perturbations in glandular lumenal architecture. METHODS: By recapitulating algorithmically how a pathologist reviews prostate tissue sections, we created an algorithmic cascade of PPMM and SIVQ algorithms as previously described by Doyle el al. [1] where PPMM identifies the glands with abnormal lumenal architecture, and this area is then screened by SIVQ to identify the epithelium. RESULTS: The performance of this algorithm cascade was assessed qualitatively (with the use of heatmaps) and quantitatively (with the use of ROC curves) and demonstrates greater performance in the identification of malignant prostatic epithelium. CONCLUSION: This ability to semi-autonomously paint nearly all the malignant epithelium of prostate cancer has immediate applications to future prostate cancer CAD development as a validated ground truth generator. In addition, such an approach has potential applications as a pre-screening/quality assurance tool.;Anal Cell Pathol (Amst). 2012.35(4):251-65. doi: 10.3233/ACP-2012-0054.;Hipp J1, Monaco J, Kunju LP, Cheng J, Yagi Y, Rodriguez-Canales J, Emmert-Buck MR, Hewitt S, Feldman MD, Tomaszewski JE, Toner M, Tompkins RG, Flotte T, Lucas D, Gilbertson JR, Madabhushi A, Balis U.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis*,Algorithms*,Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods,Humans,Male,Markov Chains,Models, Statistical,Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods,Prostate/pathology*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,ROC Curve,R01CA136535-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R03CA143991-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Instrumental variables estimation of exposure effects on a time-to-event endpoint using structural cumulative survival models.;Abstract The use of instrumental variables for estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome is popular in econometrics, and increasingly so in epidemiology. This increasing popularity may be attributed to the natural occurrence of instrumental variables in observational studies that incorporate elements of randomization, either by design or by nature (e.g., random inheritance of genes). Instrumental variables estimation of exposure effects is well established for continuous outcomes and to some extent for binary outcomes. It is, however, largely lacking for time-to-event outcomes because of complications due to censoring and survivorship bias. In this article, we make a novel proposal under a class of structural cumulative survival models which parameterize time-varying effects of a point exposure directly on the scale of the survival function. these models are essentially equivalent with a semi-parametric variant of the instrumental variables additive hazards model. We propose a class of recursive instrumental variable estimators for these exposure effects, and derive their large sample properties along with inferential tools. We examine the performance of the proposed method in simulation studies and illustrate it in a Mendelian randomization study to evaluate the effect of diabetes on mortality using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We further use the proposed method to investigate potential benefit from breast cancer screening on subsequent breast cancer mortality based on the HIP-study.;Biometrics. 2017 Dec.73(4):1140-1149. doi: 10.1111/biom.12699.

0;Infrared microspectroscopy and artificial neural networks in the diagnosis of cervical cancer.;Abstract Infrared spectra of 88 normal and 32 abnormal (mild to severe dysplasia) cervical smear samples were used as a databank to investigate the usefulness of artificial neural networks (ANN) in the diagnosis of cervical smears. The spectra were first reduced, using principal component analysis (PCA), to seven wavenumber components that are the major contributors to the variance. A number of different ANN architectures were investigated that could differentiate between normal and abnormal cervical smears. Although the ANNs were trained to differentiate only normal from abnormal smears, the results using an independent test data set indicated that within the abnormal category mild dysplasia could be distinguished from severe dysplasia. The results using this restricted data set indicate that neural networks coupled to infrared microspectroscopy could provide an alternative automated means of screening for cervical cancer.;Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 1998 Feb.44(1):179-87.;Romeo M1, Burden F, Quinn M, Wood B, McNaughton D.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Female,Humans,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Spectrophotometry, Infrared/methods*,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/classification,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/classification,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Vaginal Smears;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Influences of ethnicity, treatment, and comorbidity on breast cancer survival in Hawaii.;Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine factors contributing to the ethnic discrepancies in breast cancer survival described previously. Through the use of the Hawaii Tumor Registry and insurance claims data, 1,052 breast cancer patients' survival times were examined in relation to demographics, disease characteristics, comorbidity, and treatment patterns as compared to national guidelines for breast cancer treatment. In stepwise and hierarchical Cox regression models, TNM stage was the strongest predictor of survival and explained all of the ethnic survival differences. In addition, comorbidity and treatment patterns were significant in predicting survival. In this population of health plan members, ethnic differences in survival were not a result of differential treatment, but due to variations in early detection. These results support the hypothesis that pre-existing conditions and treatment patterns are related to breast cancer survival even after controlling for stage at diagnosis indicating the usefulness of insurance claims data in this research field.;J Clin Epidemiol. 2003 Jul.56(7):678-85.;Maskarinec G1, Pagano IS, Yamashiro G, Issell BF.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Comorbidity,Female,Hawaii/epidemiology,Humans,Insurance Claim Reporting/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Pilot Projects,Practice Guidelines as Topic,Proportional Hazards Models,Registries,Survival Analysis,N01-PC67001/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Inference on cancer screening exam accuracy using population-level administrative data.;Abstract This paper develops a model for cancer screening and cancer incidence data, accommodating the partially unobserved disease status, clustered data structures, general covariate effects, and dependence between exams. The true unobserved cancer and detection status of screening participants are treated as latent variables, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to estimate the Bayesian posterior distributions of the diagnostic error rates and disease prevalence. We show how the Bayesian approach can be used to draw inferences about screening exam properties and disease prevalence while allowing for the possibility of conditional dependence between two exams. The techniques are applied to the estimation of the diagnostic accuracy of mammography and clinical breast examination using data from the Ontario Breast Screening Program in Canada.;Stat Med. 2016 Jan 15.35(1):130-46. doi: 10.1002/sim.6619.

0;Indirect calculation of breast tissue impedance values.;Abstract One of the problems facing anyone attempting the investigation of dielectric properties of living tissue is the presence of skin, which screens all that lies under it from direct measurement. Thus, in non-invasive breast examination using transimpedance measurements, skin parameters heavily influence the results, specifically at low (less than 10 kHz) frequencies. In this paper a method for overcoming this difficulty by using multi-frequency measurements obtained from a surface current distribution over a flat probe is described. By using the variation in the shape of the real and imaginary parts of the surface current density at different frequencies, the original dielectric values of the skin and the underlying tissue can be obtained, based on the assumption of the existence of a two-layer geometry, with the upper (skin) layer much thinner than the lower (tissue) layer. The results obtained can be used in the diagnosis of breast cancer using existing transimpedance measurement devices.;Physiol Meas. 2002 Feb.23(1):177-82.;Ultchin Y1, Nachaliel U, Ori A.;Algorithms,Breast/physiology*,Computer Simulation,Electric Impedance*,Female,Humans,Linear Models,Models, Biological,Skin/anatomy & histology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Incremental net benefit and acceptability of alternative health policies: a case study of mass screening for colorectal cancer.;Abstract The incremental net benefit (INB) and the related acceptability curves for public health programs provide valuable tools for decision making. We proposed to apply them to the assessment of mass screening of colorectal cancer. The now standard guaiac fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is already implemented in several countries. We considered the innovative immunological FOBT and computed tomography colonography (CTC) as competing screening technologies. Using biennial guaiac FOBT as the reference strategy, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of the following alternatives: biennial immunological FOBT, CTC every 5 years (strategy CTC5), and CTC every 10 years (strategy CTC10). Over a 30-year horizon and from the perspective of a third-party payer, we developed a Markov model on a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 subjects at average risk of colorectal cancer. Close expected net benefits between immunological FOBT and CTC5 induced uncertainty in the choice of the optimal strategy. Probabilistic sensibility analysis then suggested that below a willingness to pay (WTP) per life-years gained (LYG) of 8,587 €/LYG, CTC10 was optimal, while CTC5 would be preferred beyond a WTP of 8,587 €/LYG.;Eur J Health Econ. 2012 Jun.13(3):237-50. doi: 10.1007/s10198-011-0300-8.

0;Incidence, mortality and survival from invasive cervical cancer in Vaud, Switzerland, 1974-1991.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Several factors have contributed to the substantial decline in mortality from cervical cancer registered in most areas of the world, i.e., improved sexual hygiene, changes in reproductive factors, cervical screening, and, possibly, improved treatment. Each of these components is evaluated through a systematic inspection of trends in incidence, mortality and survival rates registered for a well-defined population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Trends in incidence, mortality and survival from invasive cervical cancer over the period 1974-1991 were analysed for three separate age groups (< 55, 55-64, > or = 65 years), histological type and stage using data from the Cancer Registry of the Swiss Canton of Vaud. RESULTS: Below age 55, the age-standardized (world standard) incidence rate was 9.3/100,000 women in 1974-76, it declined steadily thereafter down to 2.9 in 1986-88, but increased to 4.3 in 1989-91. In the age group 55-64, cervical cancer incidence remained around 40/100,000 to the end of the 1970s, but thereafter declined to 10.9 in 1989-91. No consistent trend was observed in elderly women, and the rate in 1989-91 (26.7/100,000) was similar to that in 1974-76 (33.7). The overall age-standardized cervical cancer incidence declined from 13.5/100,000 in 1974-76 to 5.8 in 1986-88, but rose to 6.4 in 1989-91. A similar pattern was observed for mortality, with a fall in rates in younger women between 1974 and 1985 (from 2.1 to 0.6/100,000), and a subsequent rise to 1.1/100,000 in 1989-91. A substantial decline in mortality was observed in women aged 55 to 64 since the early 1980's, from 17.2 in 1980-82 to 3.3 in 1989-91. No clear mortality trend was evident in older women. Overall, cervical cancer mortality declined from 4.3/100,000 in 1974-76 to 2.3 in 1989-91. The five-year relative survival rates were around 0.70-0.75 for younger women, around 0.60 for those aged 55 to 64, and 0.50 for elderly ones. In a Cox proportional hazard model, age and clinical stage were significantly related to survival, but not histological type and calendar period of diagnosis. No substantial change in survival from invasive cervical cancer was observed over the 18-year period considered, nor was there any notable change in the stage distribution over time. The proportion of adenocarcinomas, however, appears to have increased in the most recent calendar period. CONCLUSIONS: These data reflect the impact of screening on cervical cancer rates, which, however, appeared restricted to women below age 65. An upward trend in cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates for younger women was also apparent, and there was no indication from these data of an improved survival for invasive cervical cancer patients over the last two decades. Extention of screening to elderly women appears to be a priority for reducing cervical cancer rates in this population.;Ann Oncol. 1994 Oct.5(8):747-52.;Levi F1, La Vecchia C, Randimbison L, Te VC.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adenocarcinoma/epidemiology,Adenocarcinoma/mortality,Adenocarcinoma/pathology,Aged,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/mortality,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology,Epidemiology/trends,Female,Humans,Incidence,Life Tables,Middle Aged,Mortality/trends,Multivariate Analysis,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Proportional Hazards Models,Registries,Survival Rate/trends,Switzerland/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;In situ duct carcinoma of the breast: clinical and histopathologic factors and association with recurrent carcinoma.;Abstract There has been a recent increase in the diagnosis of in situ duct carcinoma of the breast (DCIS) as a result of mammographic screening. DCIS is heterogeneous in appearance and likely in prognosis. There is no generally accepted model to predict progression to invasive carcinoma. We investigated the prognostic effect of clinical presentation and pathologic factors for women diagnosed with primary DCIS. A cohort of 124 patients was accrued between 1979 and 1994 and was followed to 1997. 78 had DCIS detected mammographically, and 88 underwent lumpectomy alone. In this article, we provide details about characteristics affecting the choice of primary therapeutic modality, and we examine the effects of factors on progression for the two patient subgroups. Presentation with bloody nipple discharge was associated with a significant increase in DCIS recurrence (p=0.07). The pattern of duct distribution was important: DCIS in which the involved ducts were more widely separated had a significantly greater recurrence of DCIS than when the involved ducts were more concentrated (p=0.08 for mammographically detected DCIS, p=0.07 for patients who underwent lumpectomy alone). For mammographically detected DCIS, younger patients had more DCIS recurrence (p=0.07). We found considerable heterogeneity in nuclear grade. 50% of patients exhibited more than one grade. Nuclear grade, necrosis, and architecture were not significantly associated with either recurrence of DCIS or development of invasive carcinoma. Longer follow-up will allow further evaluation of the prognostic relevance of the factors assessed.;Breast J. 2001 Sep-Oct.7(5):292-302.;Miller NA1, Chapman JA, Fish EB, Link MA, Fishell E, Wright B, Lickley HL, McCready DR, Hanna WM.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/pathology*,Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/therapy,Cohort Studies,Disease Progression,Disease-Free Survival,Female,Humans,Mammography,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology*,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

0;Improving the NHS cervical screening laboratory performance indicators by making allowance for population age, risk and screening interval.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: One of the key performance measures in the monitoring of the NHS cervical screening programme is the targeting of laboratories with very high or low percentages (outside the 10th-90th percentile) of adequate smears that have moderate dyskaryosis or worse. These laboratories are assumed to include those laboratories that may have extremes of sensitivity and specificity. A clear limitation with this methodology is that laboratories do not examine smears from women with the same underlying risk, age distribution or screening interval and adjustment for these factors should considerably improve the method. METHODS: This paper describes a method that allows for these confounding variables and a new age-risk-interval adjusted moderate dyskaryosis or worse rate (ARI-adjusted mod+ rate) can be calculated. The adjusted rate is the rate of moderate or worse dyskaryotic smears that the laboratory would have detected had it been screening women with an English 'average' age-risk-interval. All laboratories can therefore be compared using this method. RESULTS: The methodology is illustrated using data from the NHSCSP South West Region. The particularly low percentage of moderate or worse smears detected by one or two laboratories can be shown to be due to a local screened population with a very low risk because of a high mean age, relatively short screening interval and census variables associated with a low risk, rather than any under-calling by the associated laboratories. CONCLUSIONS: The ARI-adjusted mod+ rate requires to be calculated for all laboratories in England if it is to be used as a primary performance indicator. Alternatively, it can be used to further examine laboratories that are deemed to be outliers using the current methodology.;Cytopathology. 2006 Dec.17(6):323-38.;Blanks RG1, Moss SM, Denton K.;Adult,Age Factors,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/standards,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Risk Factors,State Medicine,United Kingdom,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Vaginal Smears/methods*,Vaginal Smears/standards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

0;Impact on survival of early detection of isolated breast recurrences after the primary treatment for breast cancer: a meta-analysis.;Abstract PURPOSE: The purpose was to establish the impact on survival of early detection of a local recurrence of breast cancer as compared to late detection. DESIGN: A meta-analysis was carried out using Cochrane review manager software (RevMan version 4.2). Studies were included if women were treated for primary breast cancer without evidence of distant metastasis at primary diagnosis and if these concerned routine follow-up strategies focusing on the early detection of curable recurrences. Data regarding the risk for death were derived from each study. Multi level models were used to study heterogeneity by using MLWin. RESULTS: Thirteen studies concerning 2,263 patients were included. Early detection of breast cancer recurrences during follow-up gave a significantly better survival as compared to late detected recurrences (HR: 1.68 (95% CI: 1.48-1.91)). Survival was better when the recurrence was found by mammography instead of physical examination or in patients without symptoms as compared to those with symptoms (HR: 2.44 (95% CI: 1.78-3.35). HR: 1.56 (95% CI: 1.36-1.79), respectively). If all breast cancer recurrences would be detected earlier, that 5-8 deaths (i.e. an absolute reduction in mortality of 17-28%) would be avoided by performing routine follow-up during a 10 year-period for 1,000 breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that detection of isolated loco-regional or contra-lateral breast cancer recurrences in patients without symptoms has beneficial impact on survival of breast cancer patients when compared to late symptomatic detection.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2009 Apr.114(3):403-12. doi: 10.1007/s10549-008-0023-4.

1;Impact of whole-body CT screening on the cost-effectiveness of CT colonography.;Abstract PURPOSE: To analyze the impact of adding computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the chest on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CT colonography to determine whether performing CT colonography and whole-body CT is a more clinically and cost-effective strategy than CT colonography alone when screening average-risk subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model simulated the occurrence of colorectal neoplasia, extracolonic abominal-pelvic malignancy, lung cancer, coronary artery disease (CAD), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in a cohort of 100,000 U.S. subjects aged 50 to 100 years. Cost-effectiveness of CT colonography and whole-body CT was compared with that of CT colonography alone. each test was assumed to be repeated every 10 years between ages of 50 and 80 years. RESULTS: Performing CT colonography and whole-body CT was more effective and costly than was CT colonography alone. The addition of chest CT was associated with a 22% increase in efficacy (life-years gained: 14,662 vs 11,990) and with a 48% increase in cost per person ($13,605 vs $9,223). Both strategies were cost effective as compared with no screening, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $17,672 (CT colonography alone) and $44,337 (CT colonography and whole-body CT), respectively, but performing CT colonography and whole-body CT was not a cost-effective option when compared with CT colonography alone (ICER, $164,020). This was mainly a result of the high cost of false-positive follow-up for CAD and to the poor efficacy of lung cancer screening. Expected value of perfect information was $520 per patient. CONCLUSION: The addition of chest CT to CT colonography does not appear to be a cost-effective alternative.

QuaMaDi provides a standardized diagnostic process for symptomatic or at risk women of all ages. The process includes independent double-reading of mammograms, additional ultrasound, and if suspicious an expert reading and assessment. We tested the hypothesis that QuaMaDi has influenced breast cancer epidemiology and survival positively. METHODS: The QuaMaDi cohort of breast cancer patients, diagnosed within the programme between 2001 and 2007, was linked to the cancer registry dataset of all breast cancer cases in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. By this record-linkage procedure participants of QuaMaDi could be marked in the cancer registry data. Overall survival rates of 3096 patients diagnosed within QuaMaDi were compared to 5417 patients diagnosed outside QuaMaDi, matched by year of diagnosis, using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Crude hazard ratio for overall survival was HR 0.43 (95% CI 0.35-0.52) for breast cancer cases detected inside QuaMaDi versus those diagnosed outside the programme. After stepwise adjustment for age, grading, histology, treatment, and tumour stage, the survival advantage in QuaMaDi diagnosed breast cancer patients was still statistically significant (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.96). CONCLUSION: Evidence is provided that the QuaMaDi programme has a beneficial impact on the first 5-year overall survival rate after breast cancer beyond a favourable tumour stage distribution. Thus, we conclude that QuaMaDi contributes to improved health care for women, who are not eligible for mammography screening. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

0;Impact of technology overlapping: a case study on colorectal cancer screening.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Technology overlapping is a phenomenon based on the availability of different technologies to treat the same morbidity in the same patient group. The aim of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of technology overlapping in a case study on colorectal cancer (CRC), and describe an approach to investigate the phenomena and to propose adequate interventions. METHODS: A Semi-Markov model, based on a cohort of 10,000 people undergoing a CRC diagnostic test, was developed to simulate the overlapping phenomena and compare it with hypothetical scenarios where only one diagnostic tool is available. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted on parameters with the greatest uncertainty. RESULTS: The results of the Semi-Markov model indicated that technology overlapping is not cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a first attempt to address the significance of technology overlapping. The Semi-Markov model demonstrated that technology overlapping is the least cost-effective arm, so alternate health care policies must be investigated.;Technol Health Care. 2010.18(4-5):303-15. doi: 10.3233/THC-2010-0594.;Di Bidino R1, Cicchetti A, Corio M, Polisena J, Oradei M, Marchetti M.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Colonoscopy/methods,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice,Humans,Markov Chains,Middle Aged,Occult Blood,Quality of Life;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Impact of risk factors on different interval cancer subtypes in a population-based breast cancer screening programme.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Interval cancers are primary breast cancers diagnosed in women after a negative screening test and before the next screening invitation. Our aim was to evaluate risk factors for interval cancer and their subtypes and to compare the risk factors identified with those associated with incident screen-detected cancers. METHODS: We analyzed data from 645,764 women participating in the Spanish breast cancer screening program from 2000-2006 and followed-up until 2009. A total of 5,309 screen-detected and 1,653 interval cancers were diagnosed. Among the latter, 1,012 could be classified on the basis of findings in screening and diagnostic mammograms, consisting of 489 true interval cancers (48.2%), 235 false-negatives (23.2%), 172 minimal-signs (17.2%) and 114 occult tumors (11.3%). Information on the screening protocol and women's characteristics were obtained from the screening program registry. Cause-specific Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) of risks factors for interval cancer and incident screen-detected cancer. A multinomial regression model, using screen-detected tumors as a reference group, was used to assess the effect of breast density and other factors on the occurrence of interval cancer subtypes. RESULTS: A previous false-positive was the main risk factor for interval cancer (HR = 2.71, 95%CI: 2.28-3.23). this risk was higher for false-negatives (HR = 8.79, 95%CI: 6.24-12.40) than for true interval cancer (HR = 2.26, 95%CI: 1.59-3.21). A family history of breast cancer was associated with true intervals (HR = 2.11, 95%CI: 1.60-2.78), previous benign biopsy with a false-negatives (HR = 1.83, 95%CI: 1.23-2.71). High breast density was mainly associated with occult tumors (RRR = 4.92, 95%CI: 2.58-9.38), followed by true intervals (RRR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.18-2.36) and false-negatives (RRR = 1.58, 95%CI: 1.00-2.49). CONCLUSION: The role of women's characteristics differs among interval cancer subtypes. This information could be useful to improve effectiveness of breast cancer screening programmes and to better classify subgroups of women with different risks of developing cancer.;PLoS One. 2014 Oct 21.9(10):e110207. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0110207. eCollection 2014.;Blanch J1, Sala M2, Ibáñez J3, Domingo L4, Fernandez B5, Otegi A6, Barata T7, Zubizarreta R5, Ferrer J8, Castells X2, Rué M9, Salas D3.

0;Impact of COPD and emphysema on survival of patients with lung cancer: A meta-analysis of observational studies.;Abstract Both COPD and emphysema are associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer, but the impacts of these comorbidities on lung cancer prognosis are still unclear. Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify whether the presence of these comorbidities indicates poor survival in patients with lung cancer. A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, ASCO Abstracts and Cochrane library for articles published before 1 June 2015. Papers referenced by the obtained articles were also reviewed. Main outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with lung cancer. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Of 58 full texts reviewed, 26 met our inclusion criteria that were derived from 21 and seven studies examining the impacts of COPD and emphysema on survival of lung cancer, respectively. Meta-analyses revealed that concomitant COPD was associated with poorer OS (HR, 1.17. 95% CI: 1.10-1.25, n = 20), which was independent of tumour staging, diagnostic criteria of COPD or location, and DFS (HR, 1.52. 95% CI: 1.04-2.23, n = 6) with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 78%). The presence of emphysema in patients with lung cancer predicted worse OS (HR, 1.66. 95% CI: 1.25-2.22, n = 7), but not poorer DFS. The presence of COPD and emphysema are robust predictors of poor survival in patients with lung cancer. Early detection of these diseases should be taken into account for lung cancer surveillance and management.;Respirology. 2016 Feb.21(2):269-79. doi: 10.1111/resp.12661.

0;Immunohistochemically detected micrometastases in peribronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes from patients with T1, N0, M0 pulmonary adenocarcinomas.;Abstract The T1, N0, M0 subset of stage I lung adenocarcinoma is a tumor that has a 5-year disease-free survival rate of 66% to 85%. To date, there has not been a rigorous immunohistochemically detected lymph node micrometastasis study composed of patients with identical stage and type of tumors, and in which standard histologic features were incorporated into multivariate analyses. We immunohistochemically examined the peribronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes from 80 consecutively accrued patients with T1, N0, M0 adenocarcinomas and bronchioloalveolar carcinomas unselected for distant metastasis, and an additional 39 patients with similar stage and type neoplasms who were selected for their development of metastases to evaluate the prevalence of micrometastases, their association with distant metastases, and their relationship with other pathologic prognostic features. All slides were stained with keratin AE1/3. Micrometastases were confirmed with Ber-Ep4. Three immunohistochemically detected lymph node micrometastases were identified in three of 80 consecutively accrued patients (4%). These three positive stains constituted 0.5% of the 573 stains required to immunohistochemically screen all of the lymph node blocks from these patients. Among the 39 patients who were selected because they developed distant metastases, three immunohistochemically detected lymph node micrometastases from three patients were identified, which constituted 8% of patients in this group and 1% of the 280 stains required to screen all of these patients' lymph nodes. Small vessel invasion, maximum tumor dimension, and immunohistochemically detected lymph node micrometastases were independently associated with metastases on multivariate analysis. Among patients who developed metastases, there was no significant difference in the disease-free survival rate between those with and those without immunohistochemically detected lymph node micrometastases. Given the low sensitivity in terms of the number of immunohistochemical stains performed, and the prognostic significance of standard histologic features, the use of immunohistochemical screening lymph nodes from all patients with T1, N0, M0 adenocarcinomas is questionable.;Am J Surg Pathol. 2000 Feb.24(2):274-9.;Goldstein NS1, Mani A, Chmielewski G, Welsh R, Pursel S.;Adenocarcinoma/chemistry,Adenocarcinoma/secondary,Adenocarcinoma, Bronchiolo-Alveolar/chemistry,Adenocarcinoma, Bronchiolo-Alveolar/secondary*,Antigens, Surface/analysis,Biomarkers, Tumor*,Bronchi/pathology*,Humans,Immunohistochemistry,Keratins/analysis,Lung Neoplasms/chemistry,Lung Neoplasms/pathology*,Lymph Nodes/chemistry,Lymph Nodes/pathology*,Lymphatic Metastasis,Mediastinum/pathology*,Neoplasm Staging,Proportional Hazards Models,Antigens, Surface,Biomarkers, Tumor,human epithelial antigen-125,Keratins;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Identifying putative drug targets and potential drug leads: starting points for virtual screening and docking.;Abstract The availability of 3D models of both drug leads (small molecule ligands) and drug targets (proteins) is essential to molecular docking and computational drug discovery. This chapter describes a simple approach that can be used to identify both drug leads and drug targets using two popular Web-accessible databases: (1) DrugBank and (2) The Human Metabolome Database. First, it is illustrated how putative drug targets and drug leads for exogenous diseases (i.e., infectious diseases) can be readily identified and their 3D structures selected using only the genomic sequences from pathogenic bacteria or viruses as input. The second part illustrates how putative drug targets and drug leads for endogenous diseases (i.e., noninfectious diseases or chronic conditions) can be identified using similar databases and similar sequence input. This chapter is intended to illustrate how bioinformatics and cheminformatics can work synergistically to help provide the necessary inputs for computer-aided drug design.;Methods Mol Biol. 2015.1215:425-44. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-1465-4_19.;Wishart DS1.;Amino Acid Sequence,Antineoplastic Agents/analysis,Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use,Antiviral Agents/analysis,Antiviral Agents/chemistry,Antiviral Agents/pharmacology,Databases as Topic,Drug Delivery Systems*,Drug Design*,Drug Evaluation, Preclinical*,HIV Protease/chemistry,Humans,Male,Metabolome,Molecular Docking Simulation*,Molecular Sequence Data,Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy,User-Computer Interface*,Antineoplastic Agents,Antiviral Agents,HIV Protease,p16 protease, Human immunodeficiency virus 1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;How to improve cytologic screening for endocervical adenocarcinoma?;Abstract AIM: A retrospective study was undertaken to investigate how to improve the diagnosis of endocervical adenocarcinoma in screening programs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 29 slides of women diagnosed with cancer but who had negative smears. The slides were subdivided in 12 smears taken less than one year before diagnosis by histology and 17 smears taken between one and 10 years prior to diagnosis. A hundred smears of healthy women were used for comparison. All smears were studied macroscopically after which both groups of smears were scanned by the Neural Network Scanner (NNS). Differences between groups were studied for statistical significance using Pearson's Chi-squared test. FINDINGS: The macroscopic parameter of these smears found to be present most frequently was a heavy admixture of blood. The presence of blood (lysed or not) in the smears was equally consistently highlighted by the NNS. Statistical significance of the association of this parameter, with the presence of cancer, was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The awareness of blood as a background feature of adenocarcinoma of the cervix will help to select cases needing special attention. These difficult bloody smears, studied by light microscopy and by NNS images can also be selected for additional MiB-1 staining. With this approach, blood in smears, otherwise frequently leading to a compromise of classification, can become a blessing in disguise. The diagnosis of endocervical adenocarcinoma in screening smears will therefore be improved.;Eur J Gynaecol Oncol. 2002.23(6):481-5.;Boon ME1, Ouwerkerk-Noordam E, van Leeuwen AW, Kok LP, van Haaften-Day C.;Evaluation Studies,Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis*,Adenocarcinoma/pathology,Case-Control Studies,Female,Humans,Netherlands,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Predictive Value of Tests,Quality Assurance, Health Care*,Retrospective Studies,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Vaginal Smears/standards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;How does early detection by screening affect disease progression? Modeling estimated benefits in prostate cancer screening.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Simulation models are essential tools for estimating benefits of cancer screening programs. Such models include a screening-effect model that represents how early detection by screening followed by treatment affects disease-specific survival. Two commonly used screening-effect models are the stage-shift model, where mortality benefits are explained by the shift to more favorable stages, and the cure model, where early detection enhances the chances of cure from disease. OBJECTIVE: This article describes commonly used screening-effect models and analyses their predicted mortality benefit in a model for prostate cancer screening. METHOD: The MISCAN simulation model was used to predict the reduction of prostate cancer mortality in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) Rotterdam. The screening-effect models were included in the model. For each model the predictions of prostate cancer mortality reduction were calculated. The study compared 4 screening-effect models, which are versions of the stage-shift model or the cure model. RESULTS: The stage-shift models predicted, after a follow-up of 9 years, reductions in prostate cancer mortality varying from 38% to 63% for ERSPC-Rotterdam compared with a 27% reduction observed in the ERSPC. The cure models predicted reductions in prostate cancer mortality varying from 21% to 27%. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in predicted mortality reductions show the importance of validating models to observed trial mortality data. The stage-shift models considerably overestimated the mortality reduction. Therefore, the stage-shift models should be used with care, especially when modeling the effect of screening for cancers with long lead times, such as prostate cancer.;Med Decis Making. 2011 Jul-Aug.31(4):550-8. doi: 10.1177/0272989X10396717.

0;Hormonal and reproductive factors and pancreatic cancer risk: a prospective cohort study.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: We examined pancreatic cancer risk in association with hormonal and reproductive factors in a prospective cohort study of 89,835 Canadian women, aged 40-59 at recruitment, who were enrolled in the National Breast Screening Study (NBSS). METHODS: Linkages to national cancer and mortality databases yielded data on cancer incidence and deaths of all causes, respectively, with follow-up ending between 1998 and 2000. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between hormonal and reproductive factors and risk of pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: During a mean of 16.4 years of follow-up, we observed 187 incident pancreatic cancer cases. Compared with women who were premenopausal at baseline, postmenopausal women were at significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer (odds ratio = 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45-4.09). Age at first livebirth, parity, age at menarche, use of oral contraceptive, and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) were not associated with altered pancreatic cancer risk in our study population. However, among parous women, risk increased with increasing parity. CONCLUSION: Other than the increased risk among postmenopausal women, the present study provides little support for associations with hormonal factors. Additional prospective data are needed.;Pancreas. 2005 May.30(4):369-74.;Navarro Silvera SA1, Miller AB, Rohan TE.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Canada/epidemiology,Estrogen Replacement Therapy*,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Gonadal Steroid Hormones*,Humans,Incidence,Menarche,Middle Aged,Multivariate Analysis,Pancreatic Neoplasms/mortality*,Pancreatic Neoplasms/physiopathology,Postmenopause*,Prevalence,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Risk Factors,Gonadal Steroid Hormones;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;History of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Risk of Incident Invasive Breast Cancer among Parous Women in the Nurses' Health Study II Prospective Cohort.;Abstract Background: Type II diabetes is associated with breast cancer in epidemiologic studies. Pregnancy also modifies breast cancer risk. We hypothesized that women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which shares pathogenesis and risk factors with type II diabetes, would have greater invasive breast cancer risk than parous women without a history of GDM.Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis among parous women in the Nurses' Health Study II, with mean age 35 years in 1989. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare risks of incident invasive breast cancer in women with and without a history of GDM.Results: Among 86,972 women studied, 5,188 women reported a history of GDM and 2,377 developed invasive breast cancer (100 with history of GDM, 2,277 without GDM) over 22 years of prospective follow-up. History of GDM was inversely associated with incident invasive breast cancer [HR, 0.68. 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55-0.84. P = 0.0004], compared with no history of GDM, after adjustment for body mass index, reproductive history, and other breast cancer risk factors. Findings were similar by menopausal status, although observed person-time was predominantly premenopausal (premenopausal: HR, 0.73. 95% CI, 0.56-0.96. P = 0.03. postmenopausal: HR, 0.63. 95% CI, 0.43-0.92. P = 0.02). Restricting to women undergoing mammography screening modestly attenuated the relationship (HR, 0.74. 95% CI, 0.57-0.96. P = 0.02).Conclusions: Among a large cohort of U.S. women, history of GDM was not associated with an elevated risk of subsequent invasive breast cancer.Impact: Our findings highlight the need to further investigate GDM's role in breast cancer development.

1;HIQA's CEA of Breast Screening: Pragmatic Policy Recommendations are Welcome, but ACERs Reported as ICERs are Not.;Abstract The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is Ireland's statutory cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) agency. It recently published a CEA of screening strategies for women at elevated risk of breast cancer. Although the strategies recommended by HIQA exceed Ireland's cost-effectiveness threshold, they can reasonably be welcomed as a pragmatic response to constraints on disinvestment and are expected to improve screening cost-effectiveness. What is not welcome, however, is HIQA's reporting of average cost-effectiveness ratios (ACERs) as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The distinction between ACERs and ICERs is well understood in CEA, as is the fact that ICERs not ACERs are the appropriate metric to determine cost-effectiveness. This article critiques HIQA's reporting, considering the implications for the particular case of breast cancer screening and the broader context of consistency of and confidence in CEA as a guide to resource allocation in Ireland. The reporting of ACERs as ICERs is unlikely to be of any great significance in the particular case of screening women at elevated risk of breast cancer, given likely constraints on disinvestment. Despite this, ICERs still need to be reported correctly. If thresholds are exceeded in certain cases, then it is important that decision makers appreciate by how much. More generally, using ACERs in some cases and ICERs in others raises concerns that methods are being applied inconsistently, which risks compromising confidence in CEA in Ireland. As Ireland's statutory CEA authority, HIQA has a special onus of responsibility to ensure established methods are applied correctly.;Value Health. 2015 Dec.18(8):941-5. doi: 10.1016/j.jval.2015.08.009.

1;High participation rates are not necessary for cost-effective colorectal cancer screening.;Abstract BACKGROUND: In many countries high participation is an explicit target in screening programmes. The desire for high participation often appears to drive screening policy, although it is increasingly recognized that encouraging high participation may impinge upon the rights of an individual to make an informed choice. One argument offered in support of high participation is that it improves the cost-effectiveness of screening. This is questionable on theoretical grounds, and empirically there are conflicting results. Two recent cost-effectiveness models of faecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) showed that cost-effectiveness was improved, another showed that cost-effectiveness was worsened and a fourth indicated that cost-effectiveness was unaffected by increasing the participation rate. METHODS: We assessed the extent to which different levels and patterns of participation affect cost-effectiveness, using decision modelling of three CRC screening with FOBT scenarios. We estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness (value for money) ratios for each scenario. RESULTS: The way in which participation is modelled, particularly assumptions made about the subsequent screening behaviour of non-participants (if and when a non-participant attends for subsequent screening), affects the cost-effectiveness estimates for FOBT screening programmes. 100% participation in all screening rounds gives a cost per life year saved (LYS) of USD 9705. Cost-effectiveness is worst when people who do not take part in one screening round (initial or subsequent) never take part in any future rounds of screening. Under this scenario, a participation rate of 20% in second and subsequent rounds gives a cost per LYS of USD 29,500. Under more realistic assumptions, for example the attendance of even a small proportion of non-participants in subsequent rounds, cost-effectiveness is more favourable and similar to that achieved for full participation: the scenario with a random participation rate of 20% in second and subsequent rounds for both participants and non-participants has a cost per LYS of USD 11,270. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to a commonly held view, high participation in screening programmes is not necessary to achieve cost-effectiveness. Setting high target participation rates in screening programmes does not guarantee cost-effectiveness and may in certain circumstances reduce the cost-effectiveness.;J Med Screen. 2005.12(2):96-102.;Howard K1, Salkeld G, Irwig L, Adelstein BA.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Costs and Cost Analysis,Feces,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric,Models, Theoretical,Occult Blood,Sensitivity and Specificity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Heterogeneity in mammography use across the nation: separating evidence of disparities from the disproportionate effects of geography.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Mammography is essential for early detection of breast cancer and both reduced morbidity and increased survival among breast cancer victims. Utilization is lower than national guidelines, and evidence of a recent decline in mammography use has sparked concern. We demonstrate that regression models estimated over pooled samples of heterogeneous states may provide misleading information regarding predictors of health care utilization and that comprehensive cancer control efforts should focus on understanding these differences and underlying causal factors. Our study population includes all women over age 64 with breast cancer in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registries, linked to a nationally representative 5% reference sample of Medicare-eligible women located in 11 states that span all census regions and are heterogeneous in racial and ethnic mix. Combining women with and without cancer in the sample allows assessment of previous cancer diagnosis on propensity to use mammography. Our conceptual model recognizes the interplay between individual, social, cultural, and physical environments along the pathways to health care utilization, while delineating local and more distant levels of influence among contextual variables. In regression modeling, we assess individual-level effects, direct effects of contextual factors, and interaction effects between individual and contextual factors. RESULTS: Pooling all women across states leads to quite different conclusions than state-specific models. Commuter intensity, community acculturation, and community elderly impoverishment have significant direct impacts on mammography use which vary across states. Minorities living in isolated enclaves with others of the same race/ethnicity may be either advantaged or disadvantaged, depending upon the place studied. CONCLUSION: Careful analysis of place-specific context is essential for understanding differences across communities stemming from different causal factors. Optimal policy interventions to change behavior (improve screening rates) will be as heterogeneous as local community characteristics, so no one size fits all policy can improve population health. Probability modeling with correction for clustering of individuals within multilevel contexts can reveal important differences from place to place and identify key factors to inform targeting of specific communities for further study.;Int J Health Geogr. 2008 Jun 30.7:32. doi: 10.1186/1476-072X-7-32.;Mobley LR1, Kuo TM, Driscoll D, Clayton L, Anselin L.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Female,Geography,Healthcare Disparities*,Humans,Mammography/utilization*,Models, Statistical,SEER Program,United States,R01 CA126858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA126858-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,1R01CA126858-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Helpseeking for self-discovered breast symptoms. Implications for early detection.;Abstract PURPOSE: Most breast cancer symptoms are discovered by women themselves, and at least one third of these women will be aware of their symptoms for 3 months or more before seeking an initial provider evaluation. The authors identify personal, social, and environmental influences on women's intention to seek an immediate provider evaluation (helpseek) versus to delay evaluation of a breast symptom that worried them. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY: Black women (N = 352) from the San Francisco Bay are women's organizations, community settings, and churches formed this convenience sample. Participants ranged across age, income, and educational levels. The survey contained 10 scales that measured health behavior variables, including new and existing scales augmented by items derived from prior interview and focus group investigations. RESULTS: Women of younger age and lower income were significantly less likely to intend to seek an evaluation for self-discovered breast symptoms. Single and partnered women were less likely to seek a provider evaluation than married or widowed women. Perceiving negative consequences of delaying, having previous habits of healthcare utilization, perceiving access to services, and feeling fearful were positively related to the intention to seek evaluation of breast symptoms. Holding fatalistic beliefs about getting breast cancer or dying and perceiving constraints to seeing a provider negatively influenced helpseeking intention. Racism in the healthcare delivery system was perceived, but was not a significant influence on helpseeking intention. A multiple linear regression model containing these variables explained 46% of the variance in helpseeking intention. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study shows that the intent to helpseek is not merely a matter of education and economics, but is dependent on a complex picture of personal, social, and economic factors. Gynecologic and primary care providers should consider this and the potential influences on helpseeking in the women for whom they provide cancer screening and early detection services. History taking should be expanded to assess women's ideas about the consequences of delaying evaluation of self-discovered breast symptoms, their sense of vulnerability to breast cancer, the constraints on cancer early detection they may be feeling related to role obligations, their economic or strategic limitations to accessing services, the pressures they may feel to hide a breast cancer symptom, or their own tendency to interpret the breast symptom as not threatening. Healthcare providers should not assume that helpseeking for breast symptoms is an automatic behavior for all women. Rather, providers should assess whether a women is the one in three who will delay the evaluation of a breast cancer symptom she discovers herself for months or years.;Cancer Pract. 1997 Jul-Aug.5(4):220-7.;Facione NC1, Dodd MJ, Holzemer W, Meleis AI.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,African Americans/psychology*,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology*,Breast Self-Examination*,Female,Humans,Linear Models,Middle Aged,Patient Acceptance of Health Care*,Risk Factors,Socioeconomic Factors,Surveys and Questionnaires,1-F31-NR06851-01/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Health care disparities and cervical cancer.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: We compared cervical cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis, and survival in Medicaid-insured and non-Medicaid-insured populations. METHODS: We stratified the sample by age and used ordered logistic regression to predict stage at diagnosis and used Cox proportional hazards regression to predict survival. RESULTS: Medicaid insured nearly one quarter of women diagnosed with cervical cancer. The likelihood of late-stage disease was greatest for women who enrolled in Medicaid after diagnosis. Women younger than 65 years who enrolled in Medicaid after diagnosis were more likely to die from cervical cancer than were women who were not insured by Medicaid (hazard ratio=2.40, 95% confidence interval=1.49, 3.86).

0;Generation of monoclonal antibodies against MGA and comparison of their application in breast cancer detection by immunohistochemistry.;Abstract Mammaglobin A (MGA) is an organ specific molecular biomarker for metastatic breast cancer diagnosis. However, there are still needs to develop optimal monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to detect MGA expression in breast carcinoma by immunohistochemistry. In this study, we first generated mAbs against MGA. Then, we used epitope prediction and computer-assisted structural analysis to screen five dominant epitopes and identified mAbs against five epitopes. Further immunohistochemical analysis on 42 breast carcinoma specimens showed that MHG1152 and MGD785 had intensive staining mainly in membrane, while CHH11617, CHH995 and MJF656 had more intensive staining within the cytoplasm. MGA scoring results showed that MJF656 had the highest rate (92.8%) of positive staining among five mAbs, including higher staining intensity when compared with that of MHG1152 (p < 0.01) and CHH995 (p < 0.05) and the highest the mean percentage of cells stained among mAbs. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship of positive staining rate by mAbs with patient clinical characteristics. The results suggest that MJF656 was able to detect MGA expression, especially in early clinical stage, low grade and lymph node metastasis-negative breast carcinoma. In conclusion, our study generated five mAbs against MGA and identified the best candidate for detection of MGA expression in breast cancer tissues.;Sci Rep. 2015 Aug 14.5:13073. doi: 10.1038/srep13073.;Duan C1, Yang X1, Zhang X1, Feng J2, Liu Z1, Que H1, Johnson H3, Zhao Y1, Fan Y1, Lu Y1, Zhang H1, Huang Y4, Xiu B1, Feng X1.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Animals,Antibodies, Monoclonal/chemistry,Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology*,Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis,Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology,Breast Neoplasms/chemistry*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Epitope Mapping/methods,Female,Humans,Immunoassay/methods*,Male,Mammaglobin A/analysis*,Mammaglobin A/immunology*,Mice,Mice, Inbred BALB C,Middle Aged,Models, Chemical,Molecular Docking Simulation,Protein Engineering/methods,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,Antibodies, Monoclonal,Biomarkers, Tumor,Mammaglobin A;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Gaussian process metamodeling in Bayesian value of information analysis: a case of the complex health economic model for breast cancer screening.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To determine whether allocation of resources into further research of breast cancer screening is warranted. also, to identify the parameters, for which the information would be most valuable, to prioritize the further research if deemed justifiable. METHODS: The Bayesian value of information analysis was conducted to calculate the overall expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the partial EVPI for the six groups of parameters. Computational expense of the partial EVPI calculation was challenged with the use of Multiple Linear Regression and Gaussian Process metamodels to significantly cut down the computing time. RESULTS: Of the two metamodeling techniques, the Gaussian Process was proven to perform superiorly and was therefore chosen for the partial EVPI calculation. The results indicate a considerable range in the population EVPI estimates, between euro100 and euro500 millions at the willingness-to-pay values between euro10,000 and euro40,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. The partial EVPI for the groups of parameters indicated that future research would be most valuable if directed toward obtaining more precise estimates of the cancer sojourn times. With the use of the Gaussian process metamodels, the computing time was reduced from 44 years to 47 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the large values of EVPI suggest collection of further information before choosing the screening policy, it is argued that delaying the decision would result in significantly higher opportunity loss. Therefore, the best option would be to implement the most cost-effective policy given the existing information (screening women aged 40-80 years, at 3-year intervals) and simultaneously conduct observational studies alongside the implemented policy. The decision analytic model could be in this manner periodically updated with additional information as it became available and the most cost-effective policy chosen iteratively.;Value Health. 2008 Mar-Apr.11(2):240-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00244.x.;Rojnik K1, Naversnik K.;Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Bayes Theorem*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Early Diagnosis,Female,Health Care Costs,Humans,Linear Models,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Normal Distribution,Resource Allocation,Slovenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Frictional contact mechanics methods for soft materials: application to tracking breast cancers.;Abstract Mammography is currently the most widely used screening and diagnostic tool for breast cancer. Because X-ray images are 2D projections of a 3D object, it is not trivial to localise features identified in mammogram pairs within the breast volume. Furthermore, mammograms represent highly deformed configurations of the breast under compression, thus the tumour localisation process relies on the clinician's experience. Biomechanical models of the breast undergoing mammographic compressions have been developed to overcome this limitation. In this study, we present the development of a modelling framework that implements Coulomb's frictional law with a finite element analysis using a C(1)-continuous Hermite mesh. We compared two methods of this contact mechanics implementation: the penalty method, and the augmented Lagrangian method, the latter of which is more accurate but computationally more expensive compared to the former. Simulation results were compared with experimental data from a soft silicon gel phantom in order to evaluate the modelling accuracy of each method. Both methods resulted in surface-deformation root-mean-square errors of less than 2mm, whilst the maximum internal marker prediction error was less than 3mm when simulating two mammographic-like compressions. Simulation results were confirmed using the augmented Lagrangian method, which provided similar accuracy. We conclude that contact mechanics on soft elastic materials using the penalty method with an appropriate choice of the penalty parameters provides sufficient accuracy (with contact constraints suitably enforced), and may thus be useful for tracking breast tumours between clinical images.;J Biomech. 2008.41(1):69-77.

0;Formative evaluation of the accuracy of a clinical decision support system for cervical cancer screening.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: We previously developed and reported on a prototype clinical decision support system (CDSS) for cervical cancer screening. However, the system is complex as it is based on multiple guidelines and free-text processing. Therefore, the system is susceptible to failures. This report describes a formative evaluation of the system, which is a necessary step to ensure deployment readiness of the system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Care providers who are potential end-users of the CDSS were invited to provide their recommendations for a random set of patients that represented diverse decision scenarios. The recommendations of the care providers and those generated by the CDSS were compared. Mismatched recommendations were reviewed by two independent experts. RESULTS: A total of 25 users participated in this study and provided recommendations for 175 cases. The CDSS had an accuracy of 87% and 12 types of CDSS errors were identified, which were mainly due to deficiencies in the system's guideline rules. When the deficiencies were rectified, the CDSS generated optimal recommendations for all failure cases, except one with incomplete documentation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The crowd-sourcing approach for construction of the reference set, coupled with the expert review of mismatched recommendations, facilitated an effective evaluation and enhancement of the system, by identifying decision scenarios that were missed by the system's developers. The described methodology will be useful for other researchers who seek rapidly to evaluate and enhance the deployment readiness of complex decision support systems.;J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2013 Jul-Aug.20(4):749-57. doi: 10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001613.

0;Forecasting age-specific breast cancer mortality using functional data models.;Abstract Accurate estimates of future age-specific incidence and mortality are critical for allocation of resources to breast cancer control programmes and evaluation of screening programmes. The purpose of this study is to apply functional data analysis techniques to model age-specific breast cancer mortality time trends, and forecast entire age-specific mortality functions using a state-space approach. We use annual unadjusted breast cancer mortality rates in Australia, from 1921 to 2001 in 5 year age groups (45 to 85+). We use functional data analysis techniques where mortality and incidence are modelled as curves with age as a functional covariate varying by time. Data are smoothed using non-parametric smoothing methods then decomposed (using principal components analysis) to estimate basis functions that represent the functional curve. Period effects from the fitted coefficients are forecast then multiplied by the basis functions, resulting in a forecast mortality curve with prediction intervals. To forecast, we adopt a state-space approach and an automatic modelling framework for selecting among exponential smoothing methods.Overall, breast cancer mortality rates in Australia remained relatively stable from 1960 to the late 1990s, but have declined over the last few years. A set of four basis functions minimized the mean integrated squared forecasting error and account for 99.3 per cent of variation around the mean mortality curve. Twenty year forecasts suggest a continuing decline, but at a slower rate, and stabilizing beyond 2010. Forecasts show a decline in all age groups with the greatest decline in older women. The proposed methods have the potential to incorporate important covariates such as hormone replacement therapy and interventions to represent mammographic screening. This would be particularly useful for evaluating the impact of screening on mortality and incidence from breast cancer.;Stat Med. 2007 Jan 30.26(2):458-70.;Erbas B1, Hyndman RJ, Gertig DM.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Australia/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Data Interpretation, Statistical*,Female,Forecasting/methods*,Humans,Incidence,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Finding the optimal compression level for strain-encoded (SENC) breast MRI. simulations and phantom experiments.;Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the second highest cause of cancer-related death. Diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended to screen high-risk patients. Strain-Encoded (SENC) can improve MRI's specificity by detecting and differentiating masses according to their stiffness. Previous phantom and ex-vivo studies have utilized SENC to detect cancerous masses. However, SENC required a 30% compression of the tissue, which may not be feasible for in-vivo imaging. In this work, we use finite element method simulations and phantom experiments to determine the minimum compression required to detect and classify masses. Results show that SENC is capable of detecting stiff masses at compression level of 7%, though higher compression is needed in order to differentiate between normal tissue and benign or malignant masses. With on-line SENC calculations implemented on the scanner console, we propose to start with small compressions for maximum patient comfort, then progress to larger compressions if any masses are detected.;Med Image Comput Comput Assist Interv. 2011.14(Pt 1):444-51.;Harouni AA1, Jacobs MA, Osman NF.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Algorithms,Breast/pathology*,Computer Simulation,Equipment Design,Female,Finite Element Analysis,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging/instrumentation*,Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods*,Models, Biological,Phantoms, Imaging,Poisson Distribution,Stress, Mechanical,1R01CA100184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R44 CA162870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01HL072704/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States,P50CA103175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P50CA88843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01CA140204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,1P50HL08946/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Female schizophrenia patients and risk of breast cancer: A population-based cohort study.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. This population-based cohort study aimed to examine the association between breast cancer in female schizophrenia patients and its association with the use of antipsychotics drugs. METHODS: All study subjects were selected from the Taiwan Insurance Claims Data (1998-2008). We compared the risk for breast cancer between female schizophrenia patients receiving antipsychotics (n=29,641) with female patients without any serious mental illnesses nor receiving antipsychotic drugs (n=59,282). We also compared between patients on 1) first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) alone. 2) combination of first and second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). and 3) SGAs alone. We then stratified those on SGAs into two subgroups according to their prolactin-elevating properties: risperidone (RIS), paliperidone (PAL) or amisulpride (AMI) and all other SGAs. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk of breast cancer in female schizophrenia patients was 1.94 higher than the non-schizophrenia cohort (aHR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.43-2.63). Schizophrenia patients receiving a combination of FGAs and SGAs had a slightly higher risk of breast cancer than non-schizophrenic patients (aHR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.56-3.01). Patients on RIS, PAL, and AMI had a 1.96-fold risk of breast cancer compared to the non-schizophrenic cohort (95% CI: 1.36-2.82). CONCLUSIONS: This study raises awareness among both clinicians and patients about the importance of breast cancer screening and the promotion of healthy lifestyle choices. Due to the nature of our database, confounding factors - such as parity, obesity, hormone therapy, and smoking - could not be controlled for. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

0;False-positive screening mammograms and biopsies among women participating in a Canadian provincial breast screening program.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Mammography screening results in false positives that cause anxiety and utilize scarce medical resources for their resolution. Determination of screening recommendations requires knowledge of the population risk of false positives. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Screening Mammography Program of British Columbia and analyzed to determine the influence of personal factors including age, ethnic group and screening history, and the centre where screening was performed, on the likelihood a new screen would result in a false positive and whether a biopsy was required. The resulting probabilities were combined to provide values for lifetime screening algorithms. RESULTS: Age, screen sequence number, history of previous abnormal screens and centre where screening was performed were significantly related to the likelihood a new screen would be a false positive. British Columbia women screened biennially between the ages of 50 and 69 have a projected 41% chance of a false-positive screen and a 5.6% risk of a related biopsy, with the best performing centres having rates of 26% and 3%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Model projections for BC overall are comparable to other North American estimates.

1;Faecal occult blood testing in areas of high incidence and mortality. the effect of screening the population aged 50 to 59.;Abstract AIM: In central Liverpool, the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is 119% of the national average. Currently, screening is offered to those aged 60-70 through the National Bowel Cancer screening programme. A theoretical model showing the effect of the introduction of biennial screening in individuals aged 50-59 has been applied to the population of central Liverpool. METHOD: The impact of screening using faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) in individuals aged 50-59 in central Liverpool (n = 47,440. males 23,312) was assessed by a model based on three levels of compliance. RESULTS: After modelling, the positive FOBT result for increased incidence of CRC, the positive predictive value for adenoma and cancer detection was calculated using age-specific positivity rates. The results indicate that between 120 and 162 new diagnoses of CRC per 100,000 population aged 50-59 could be detected by biennial screening, dependent on compliance rates. CONCLUSION: Screening individuals aged 50-59 can identify early cancers and significant adenomas, which may contribute to a reduction in the expected high mortality rate found in this geographical area. © 2011 The Authors.

0;Factors associated with the risk of progression to precursor lesions or cervical cancer in women with negative cytologic findings.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate factors associated with progression to cervical cancer or moderate to severe precursor lesions (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 [CIN 2] or higher) in women with negative cervical screening results. METHOD: A cohort of 1236 women from the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was followed up for 36 months. Hazards ratios (HR) and related 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate factors associated with the development of lesions grade CIN 2 or higher. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, education level, number of sexual partners, and parity, the presence of CIN 2 or more advanced lesions was associated with HPV infection (HR, 39.0. 95% CI, 9.8-156.0), smoking (HR, 7.7. 95% CI, 2.0-29.6), and early age at first sexual intercourse (HR, 4.1. 95% CI, 1.1-15.1). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that women at increased risk for cervical cancer be screened for HPV at the time of cervical screening, particularly in areas where access to health services is difficult. Antismoking strategies especially targeting young women should be a priority in a comprehensive women's health care program.;Int J Gynaecol Obstet. 2009 Dec.107(3):228-31. doi: 10.1016/j.ijgo.2009.07.036.

0;Facilitating surveillance of pulmonary invasive mold diseases in patients with haematological malignancies by screening computed tomography reports using natural language processing.;Abstract PURPOSE: Prospective surveillance of invasive mold diseases (IMDs) in haematology patients should be standard of care but is hampered by the absence of a reliable laboratory prompt and the difficulty of manual surveillance. We used a high throughput technology, natural language processing (NLP), to develop a classifier based on machine learning techniques to screen computed tomography (CT) reports supportive for IMDs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of CT reports from the clinical encounter and up to 12-weeks after, from a random subset of 79 of 270 case patients with 33 probable/proven IMDs by international definitions, and 68 of 257 uninfected-control patients identified from 3 tertiary haematology centres. The classifier was trained and tested on a reference standard of 449 physician annotated reports including a development subset (n = 366), from a total of 1880 reports, using 10-fold cross validation, comparing binary and probabilistic predictions to the reference standard to generate sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver-operating-curve (ROC). RESULTS: For the development subset, sensitivity/specificity was 91% (95%CI 86% to 94%)/79% (95%CI 71% to 84%) and ROC area was 0.92 (95%CI 89% to 94%). Of 25 (5.6%) missed notifications, only 4 (0.9%) reports were regarded as clinically significant. CONCLUSION: CT reports are a readily available and timely resource that may be exploited by NLP to facilitate continuous prospective IMD surveillance with translational benefits beyond surveillance alone.;PLoS One. 2014 Sep 24.9(9):e107797. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107797. eCollection 2014.;Ananda-Rajah MR1, Martinez D2, Slavin MA3, Cavedon L4, Dooley M5, Cheng A6, Thursky KA3.;Multicenter Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Case-Control Studies,Female,Hematologic Neoplasms/complications*,Humans,Lung Diseases/complications,Lung Diseases/diagnosis*,Lung Diseases/microbiology,Male,Middle Aged,Mycoses/complications,Mycoses/diagnosis*,Mycoses/microbiology,Natural Language Processing*,Population Surveillance,ROC Curve,Retrospective Studies,Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods*,Young Adult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

0;Experiences of racist events are associated with negative health consequences for African American women.;Abstract This study investigated whether experiences of racist events were related to psychological distress, negative health behaviors, and health problems. Participants were 71 African American women (mean age 44.4) who were recruited from an urban cancer-screening clinic as part of a larger longitudinal study on familial risk of breast cancer. Participants completed three study assessments, approximately one month apart, and data were collected via self-report. Correlational analyses revealed that past year and lifetime racism were both related to psychological distress. Among smokers and drinkers, past year racism was positively correlated with number of cigarettes and drinks consumed. Lifetime racism was negatively related to perceived health, and positively related to lifetime history of physical disease and frequency of recent common colds. Analyses using a general linear model revealed that these relationships were largely unaccounted for by other variables. In addition, demographic variables such as income and education were not related to experiences of racism. The results suggest that racism can be detrimental to African American's well being and should be investigated in health disparities research.;J Natl Med Assoc. 2003 Jun.95(6):450-60.;Kwate NO1, Valdimarsdottir HB, Guevarra JS, Bovbjerg DH.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adaptation, Psychological,Adult,African Americans/psychology*,Aged,Analysis of Variance,Female,Health Behavior,Health Status*,Humans,Linear Models,Longitudinal Studies,Middle Aged,Prejudice*,Risk Factors,Social Perception,Stress, Psychological/ethnology,Surveys and Questionnaires,Urban Population,NCI-CA 72457/CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Examining accuracy of screening mammography using an event order model.;Abstract Screening mammography is a widely used method for breast cancer detection. For each mammogram we propose a performance model based on order of outcomes. That is, we envision an initial assessment, a follow up assessment if the initial one is positive and, eventually, a determination of whether cancer was present or not. A model can be built at each stage reflecting effects due to patient characteristics, to the facility where mammogram was performed and to the radiologist reading the mammogram. Since assessment is not perfectly associated with outcome, familiar rates of agreement and disagreement are of interest. These rates can be investigated at various levels of risk factors of interest. The approach is illustrated with screening mammography data from the Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, WA. A Bayesian framework is adopted for inference and an analysis of the data set is presented.;Stat Med. 2006 Jan 30.25(2):267-83.;Paliwal P1, Gelfand AE, Abraham L, Barlow W, Elmore JG.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Data Interpretation, Statistical*,Female,Humans,Mammography/standards*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Predictive Value of Tests,R01 CA107623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 HS010591/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States,K05 CA104699/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,KO5-CA104699/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA107623-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,HS10591/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Evolving artificial neural networks for screening features from mammograms.;Abstract Disagreement or inconsistencies in mammographic interpretation motivates utilizing computerized pattern recognition algorithms to aid the assessment of radiographic features. We have studied the potential for using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to analyze interpreted radiographic features from film screen mammograms. Attention was given to 216 cases (mammogram series) that presented suspicious characteristics. The domain expert (Wasson) quantified up to 12 radiographic features for each case based on guidelines from previous literature. Patient age was also included. The existence or absence of malignancy was confirmed in each case via open surgical biopsy (111 malignant, 105 benign). ANNs of various complexity were trained via evolutionary programming to indicate whether or not a malignancy was present given a vector of scored input features in a statistical cross validation procedure. For suspicious masses, the best evolved ANNs generated a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AZ) of 0.9196 +/- 0.0040 (1 S.E.), with a mean specificity of 0.6269 +/- 0.0272 at 0.95 sensitivity. Results when microcalcifications were included were not quite as good (AZ = 0.8464), however, ANNs with only two hidden nodes performed as well as more complex ANNs and better than ANNs with only one hidden node. The performance of the evolved ANNs was comparable to prior literature, but with an order of magnitude less complexity. The success of small ANNs in diagnosing breast cancer offers the promise that suitable explanations for the ANN's behavior can be induced, leading to a greater acceptance by physicians.;Artif Intell Med. 1998 Nov.14(3):317-26.;Fogel DB1, Wasson EC 3rd, Boughton EM, Porto VW.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Artificial Intelligence,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted*,Female,Humans,Mammography*,Neural Networks (Computer)*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Evolution of uterine cervical cancer mortality from 1979 to 1998 in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.;Abstract A decrease in uterine cervical cancer (CC) mortality has been observed in developed countries. However, mortality data in Brazil suggest that CC is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death in women. it is the fourth cause of death from cancer in women in Rio Grande Sul State. A time-trend ecological study was performed to analyze CC mortality trends in Rio Grande do Sul from 1979 to 1998. Data were collected from the Mortality Information System, Brazilian Ministry of Health (DATASUS). Standardized mortality ratios were calculated and linear regression was used for time-trend analysis. The impact of cervical cancer death on life expectancy was also estimated for the study population using potential years of life lost (PYLL). Standardized mortality ratios during the study period revealed a positive linear trend of 0.17, and the mean annual mortality rate was 7.58/100,000. Cervical cancer accounted for 21.9 +/- 1.33 PYLL during the period. In conclusion, although CC is a preventable and curable disease, an increase is observed in mortality from this cause in Rio Grande do Sul State, which may suggest failure in screening programs for cervical cancer.;Cad Saude Publica. 2005 Jan-Feb.21(1):299-309.

0;Evolution and immediate future of US screening guidelines.;Abstract Although observational studies and simulation models have shed some interesting light on many of the uncertainties surrounding prostate cancer screening, well-done clinical trials provide the best evidence on screening among the extremes of age, the most appropriate interval to screen, and the best complement of tests to use. Enthusiasm for screening is temporized by the acknowledgment that overdetection leads to frequent overtreatment despite evidence supporting the safety of active surveillance in many men with low-risk disease.;Urol Clin North Am. 2014 May.41(2):229-35. doi: 10.1016/j.ucl.2014.01.005.;Greene KL1, Punnen S2, Carroll PR2.;Review,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/trends*,Morbidity/trends,Practice Guidelines as Topic/standards*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology*,United States/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Evidence-based care for breast cancer survivors: communicating the Institute of Medicine Guidelines in medical practice.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To investigate patient reports of physician communication about the 2006 Institute of Medicine (IOM) Guidelines for Survivorship Care, and patient follow-up care behaviors in a sample of African American and Caucasian breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Fifteen-minute telephone interviews were conducted in a cross-sectional study with a sample of African American (n=30) and Caucasian (n=69) breast cancer patients, who were within 5 years of their diagnosis and primary treatment for breast cancer at two Baltimore, Maryland medical centers, during the summer of 2006. Multiple items assessed patient reports of physician discussions about IOM Guidelines, their recurrence concerns, and their follow-up treatment, screening, diet and exercise practices. RESULTS: Patients with higher incomes, more education, female physicians, and of younger ages reported more complete physician discussions of the IOM Guidelines. No significant differences were noted between African American and Caucasian patients. CONCLUSION: Patients at greatest risk for breast cancer recurrence - those with less education, income, and resources - report limited guidance from their physicians about evidence-based, follow-up care guidelines, designed to minimize their risk. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Physicians need strategies for effectively delivering the IOM Guidelines for Survivorship Care to disadvantaged breast cancer patients, to promote enhanced quality of life and reduced risk of recurrence.;Patient Educ Couns. 2009 Dec.77(3):413-20. doi: 10.1016/j.pec.2009.09.042.

0;Evidence to support a change in follow-up policy for patients with breast cancer: time to first relapse and hazard rate analysis.;Abstract The ideal follow-up for patients with cancer should be sensitive to the likelihood of relapse, for prompt investigation and treatment if indicated, together with the support of patient confidence. The current British Association of Surgical Oncologists guidelines for patients with breast cancer suggest intensive follow-up, including 3-monthly clinic visits during the first 2 years. These recommendations place increasing demands on clinical resources. The combined outcome of screening, early detection, dedicated clinical services that emphasize rapid diagnosis and concomitant improved survival, have resulted in increasing absolute numbers of diagnosed breast cancer patients in follow-up clinics. This article examines the follow-up of breast cancer patients to determine if the convention should be adjusted to obtain more from current resources while maintaining equivalent patient care. The data on all patients with breast cancer attending one general oncology clinic were examined in order to determine the pattern of relapse. Analyses identified: (1) the time to relapse at any site and at specific sites. and (2) the prognostic significance of three factors for subsequent relapse, namely nodal status, menopausal status and T stage at diagnosis. In 416 consecutive patients, the annual rate of relapse of breast cancer was found to increase progressively over the first 4 years. Nodal disease was the most important single variable as a predictor of relapse. The annual hazard rate for relapse for node positive patients in the first year was 5%. this increased to 10% and 14% in years three and four respectively. In contrast, in those patients who were node negative at diagnosis (302/416. 73%), the hazard rate for relapse was 1% in year one, increasing to 5% in years three and four. Intensive early follow-up of breast cancer patients provides no clear clinical gain for the great majority of patients, since early relapse is rare in the first year. The use of clinical funds and staff resources might be optimized to focus clinical follow-up on those patients at risk of recurrence. We suggest that all patients should continue to be monitored and receive psychological care through access to their general practitioner, skilled breast care nurses and specialized counsellors. Any patient at risk, or developing symptoms of relapse, would have immediate clinical access to the oncologist for diagnostic investigations. This strategy would optimize psychological patient care and use the full backup of clinical resources during the prolonged period over which relapse becomes more probable.;Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 1999.11(3):169-73.;Wheeler T1, Stenning S, Negus S, Picken S, Metcalfe S.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Disease Progression,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Health Policy*,Humans,Longitudinal Studies,Lymphatic Metastasis,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis*,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Assessment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Evaluation of the Tyrer-Cuzick (International Breast Cancer Intervention Study) model for breast cancer risk prediction in women with atypical hyperplasia.;Abstract PURPOSE: Accurate breast cancer risk assessment is vital to personalize screening and risk reduction strategies. Women with atypical hyperplasia have a four-fold higher risk of breast cancer. We evaluated the performance of the Tyrer-Cuzick model, which was designed to predict 10-year risk of breast cancer development, in a well-defined cohort of women with atypia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Mayo Benign Breast Disease cohort includes 9,376 women who had a benign breast biopsy between 1967 and 1991. Among those, 331 women with atypia were identified by our study pathologists. Risk factor data for the Tyrer-Cuzick model were collated for each woman and used to predict individual risk of developing invasive breast cancer within 10 years. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 14.6 years, 64 (19%) of the 331 women developed invasive breast cancer. In the first 10 years after biopsy, 31 women developed invasive breast cancer whereas the Tyrer-Cuzick model predicted 58.9. The observed-to-predicted ratio was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.75). The concordance statistic was 0.540, revealing that the Tyrer-Cuzick model did not accurately distinguish, on an individual level, between women who developed invasive breast cancer and those who did not. CONCLUSION: The Tyrer-Cuzick model significantly overestimated risk of breast cancer for women with atypia, and individual risk estimates showed poor concordance between predicted risk and invasive breast cancer development. Thus, we cannot recommend the use of the Tyrer-Cuzick model to predict 10-year breast cancer risk in women with atypical hyperplasia.;J Clin Oncol. 2010 Aug 1.28(22):3591-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.28.0784.

1;Evaluation of health benefits and harms of the breast cancer screening programme in the Basque Country using discrete event simulation.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Since the breast cancer screening programme in the Basque Country (BCSPBC) was started in 1996, more than 400,000 women aged 50 to 69 years have been invited to participate. Based on epidemiological observations and simulation techniques it is possible to extend observed short term data into anticipated long term results. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the programme through 2011 by quantifying the outcomes in breast cancer mortality, life-years gained, false positive results, and overdiagnosis. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was constructed to reproduce the natural history of breast cancer (disease-free, pre-clinical, symptomatic, and disease-specific death) and the actual observed characteristics of the screening programme during the evaluated period in the Basque women population. Goodness-of-fit statistics were applied for model validation. The screening effects were measured as differences in benefits and harms between the screened and unscreened populations. Breast cancer mortality reduction and life-years gained were considered as screening benefits, whereas, overdiagnosis and false positive results were assessed as harms. Results for a single cohort were also obtained. RESULTS: The screening programme yielded a 16 % reduction in breast cancer mortality and a 10 % increase in the incidence of breast cancer through 2011. Almost 2 % of all the women in the programme had a false positive result during the evaluation period. When a single cohort was analysed, the number of deaths decreased by 13 %, and 4 % of screen-detected cancers were overdiagnosed. Each woman with BC detected by the screening programme gained 2.5 life years due to early detection corrected by lead time. CONCLUSIONS: Fifteen years after the screening programme started, this study supports an important decrease in breast cancer mortality due to the screening programme, with reasonable risk of overdiagnosis and false positive results, and sustains the continuation of the breast cancer screening programme in the Basque population.;BMC Cancer. 2015 Oct 12.15:671. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1700-4.;Arrospide A1,2,3, Rue M4,5, van Ravesteyn NT6, Comas M7,8, Larrañaga N9,10, Sarriugarte G11, Mar J12,13,14,15.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening*/methods,Middle Aged,Mortality,Registries,Risk Assessment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Evaluating the impacts of screening and smoking cessation programmes on lung cancer in a high-burden region of the USA: a simulation modelling study.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: While the US Preventive Services Task Force has issued recommendations for lung cancer screening, its effectiveness at reducing lung cancer burden may vary at local levels due to regional variations in smoking behaviour. Our objective was to use an existing model to determine the impacts of lung cancer screening alone or in addition to increased smoking cessation in a US region with a relatively high smoking prevalence and lung cancer incidence. SETTING: Computer-based simulation model. PARTICIPANTS: Simulated population of individuals 55 and older based on smoking prevalence and census data from Northeast Pennsylvania. INTERVENTIONS: Hypothetical lung cancer control from 2014 to 2050 through (1) screening with CT, (2) intensified smoking cessation or (3) a combination strategy. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were lung cancer mortality rates. Secondary outcomes included number of people eligible for screening and number of radiation-induced lung cancers. RESULTS: Combining lung cancer screening with increased smoking cessation would yield an estimated 8.1% reduction in cumulative lung cancer mortality by 2050. Our model estimated that the number of screening-eligible individuals would progressively decrease over time, indicating declining benefit of a screening-only programme. Lung cancer screening achieved a greater mortality reduction in earlier years, but was later surpassed by smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Combining smoking cessation programmes with lung cancer screening would provide the most benefit to a population, especially considering the growing proportion of patients ineligible for screening based on current recommendations.

1;Evaluating lung cancer screening in China: Implications for eligibility criteria design from a microsimulation modeling approach.;Abstract More than half of males in China are current smokers and evidence from western countries tells us that an unprecedented number of smoking-attributable deaths will occur as the Chinese population ages. We used the China Lung Cancer Policy Model (LCPM) to simulate effects of computed tomography (CT)-based lung cancer screening in China, comparing the impact of a screening guideline published in 2015 by a Chinese expert group to a version developed for the United States by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The China LCPM, built using an existing lung cancer microsimulation model, can project population outcomes associated with interventions for smoking-related diseases. After calibrating the model to published Chinese smoking prevalence and lung cancer mortality rates, we simulated screening from 2016 to 2050 based on eligibility criteria from the CMS and Chinese guidelines, which differ by age to begin and end screening, pack-years smoked, and years since quitting. Outcomes included number of screens, mortality reduction, and life-years saved for each strategy. We projected that in the absence of screening, 14.98 million lung cancer deaths would occur between 2016 and 2050. Screening with the CMS guideline would prevent 0.72 million deaths and 5.8 million life-years lost, resulting in 6.58% and 1.97% mortality reduction in males and females, respectively. Screening with the Chinese guideline would prevent 0.74 million deaths and 6.6 million life-years lost, resulting in 6.30% and 2.79% mortality reduction in males and females, respectively. Through 2050, 1.43 billion screens would be required using the Chinese screening strategy, compared to 988 million screens using the CMS guideline. In conclusion, CT-based lung cancer screening implemented in 2016 and based on the Chinese screening guideline would prevent about 20,000 (2.9%) more lung cancer deaths through 2050, but would require about 445 million (44.7%) more screens than the CMS guideline.;PLoS One. 2017 Mar 8.12(3):e0173119. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173119. eCollection 2017.;Sheehan DF1, Criss SD1, Gazelle GS1,2,3, Pandharipande PV1,2, Kong CY1,2.;Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,China/epidemiology,Computer Simulation,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Lung Neoplasms/etiology,Lung Neoplasms/mortality,Male,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Population Surveillance*,Prevalence,Risk Factors,Young Adult,U01 CA199284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Ethnic differences in mammographic densities.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer incidence is considerably lower among Japanese and Chinese women than among Caucasian and Native Hawaiian even in second and third generation migrants. Mammographic densities, which refer to the radiological appearance of the healthy female breast, are related to breast cancer risk. The purpose of this project was to explore the hypothesis that women from ethnic groups at high breast cancer risk are more likely to have high levels of densities than women from low breast cancer risk groups. METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, 514 pre- and post-menopausal women recruited at mammography screening clinics completed a self-administered questionnaire. We used a computer-assisted method to measure the dense and the total areas of the breast and to compute per cent breast density. Student's t-tests and multiple linear regression were applied to examine ethnic differences and to explore determinants of mammographic densities, respectively. RESULTS: The unadjusted mean dense area was 15% smaller in Chinese and Japanese women than in the Caucasian/Hawaiian group. However, because of their smaller breast size, the per cent of the breast occupied by dense tissue in Chinese and Japanese women was 20% higher than in Caucasian women. Body mass index, age, menopausal status, parity, and oestrogen therapy were associated with mammographic densities, but they did not account for all ethnic differences. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas this study detected some ethnic differences in mammographic densities, the importance of dense areas and per cent densities as indicators of breast cancer risk in ethnically diverse populations remains to be clarified.;Int J Epidemiol. 2001 Oct.30(5):959-65.;Maskarinec G1, Meng L, Ursin G.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Asian Continental Ancestry Group*,Breast/anatomy & histology*,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology*,China/epidemiology,Cross-Sectional Studies,European Continental Ancestry Group*,Female,Hawaii/epidemiology,Humans,Incidence,Japan/ethnology,Linear Models,Mammography*,Middle Aged,5-K12 CA 01708/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Estimation of test sensitivity and specificity when disease confirmation is limited to positive results.;Abstract Estimation of sensitivity and specificity for diagnostic or screening tests usually requires independent confirmation of subjects as diseased or nondiseased using a gold standard. In practice, however, application of the confirmatory procedure is usually limited to individuals with one or more positive test results. For situations in which two initial tests are applied, recent literature has shown that one can use the data from confirmed disease cases to estimate the ratio of test sensitivities and the information from confirmed noncases to estimate the ratio of false-positive rates. In this paper, I show that estimates of sensitivity and specificity can be obtained for each test separately, together with an estimate of the disease prevalence. The only additional information required compared with previous methodology is the total number of individuals tested, a quantity that is usually readily available. The assumption that the test errors are independent is required. Although specific patterns of test errors cannot be identified, the overall assumption can be tested using goodness of fit. I illustrate the methods using data on breast cancer screening. Provision of sensitivity and specificity estimates for each test separately provide considerably greater insight into the data than previous methods.;Epidemiology. 1999 Jan.10(1):67-72.;Walter SD1.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures*,Humans,Mammography,Models, Statistical*,Physical Examination,Sensitivity and Specificity*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Estimation of sojourn time in chronic disease screening without data on interval cases.;Abstract Estimation of the sojourn time on the preclinical detectable period in disease screening or transition rates for the natural history of chronic disease usually rely on interval cases (diagnosed between screens). However, to ascertain such cases might be difficult in developing countries due to incomplete registration systems and difficulties in follow-up. To overcome this problem, we propose three Markov models to estimate parameters without using interval cases. A three-state Markov model, a five-state Markov model related to regional lymph node spread, and a five-state Markov model pertaining to tumor size are applied to data on breast cancer screening in female relatives of breast cancer cases in Taiwan. Results based on a three-state Markov model give mean sojourn time (MST) 1.90 (95% CI: 1.18-4.86) years for this high-risk group. Validation of these models on the basis of data on breast cancer screening in the age groups 50-59 and 60-69 years from the Swedish Two-County Trial shows the estimates from a three-state Markov model that does not use interval cases are very close to those from previous Markov models taking interval cancers into account. For the five-state Markov model, a reparameterized procedure using auxiliary information on clinically detected cancers is performed to estimate relevant parameters. A good fit of internal and external validation demonstrates the feasibility of using these models to estimate parameters that have previously required interval cancers. This method can be applied to other screening data in which there are no data on interval cases.;Biometrics. 2000 Mar.56(1):167-72.;Chen TH1, Kuo HS, Yen MF, Lai MS, Tabar L, Duffy SW.;Aged,Biometry,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/secondary,Chronic Disease,Female,Humans,Lymphatic Metastasis,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Estimation of sensitivity depending on sojourn time and time spent in preclinical state.;Abstract The probability model for periodic screening was extended to provide statistical inference for sensitivity depending on sojourn time, in which the sensitivity was modeled as a function of time spent in the preclinical state and the sojourn time. The likelihood function with the proposed sensitivity model was then evaluated with simulated data to check its reliability in terms of the mean estimation and the standard error. Simulation results showed that the maximum likelihood estimates of the proposed model have little bias and small standard errors. The extended probability model was further applied to the Johns Hopkins Lung Project data using both maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo.;Stat Methods Med Res. 2016 Apr.25(2):728-40. doi: 10.1177/0962280212465499.

0;Estimation of screening test (Hemoccult) sensitivity in colorectal cancer mass screening.;Abstract 3 controlled cohorts of mass-screening for colorectal cancer using a biennial faecal occult blood (HemoccultII test on well-defined European populations have demonstrated a 14% to 18% reduction in specific mortality. We aimed to estimate the sensitivity (S) of this HemoccultII test and and also mean sojourn time (MST) from French colorectal mass-screening programme data. 6 biennial screening rounds were performed from 1988 to 1998 in 45 603 individuals aged 45-74 years in Saône-et-Loire (Burgundy, France). The prevalent/incidence ratio was calculated in order to obtain a direct estimate of the product S.MST. The analysis of the proportional incidence and its modelling was used to derive an indirect estimate of S and MST. The product S.MST was higher for males than females and higher for left colon than either the right colon or rectum. The analysis of the proportional incidence confirmed the result for subsites but no other significant differences were found. The sensitivity was estimated at 0.57 and the MST at 2.56 years. This study confirms that the sensitivity of the Hemoccult test is relatively low and that the relatively short sojourn time is in favour of annual screening.;Br J Cancer. 2001 Jun 1.84(11):1477-81.;Jouve JL1, Remontet L, Dancourt V, Lejeune C, Benhamiche AM, Faivre J, Esteve J.;Evaluation Studies,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,False Negative Reactions,Female,Humans,Incidence,Male,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Occult Blood*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Time Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Estimating treatment cost functions for progressive diseases: a multiproduct approach with an application to breast cancer.;Abstract Using the theory of multiproduct cost functions, a treatment cost function is derived for diseases which progress through a number of stages. The output classes are conceived as the stages at detection of the disease, with the unit of output within each class being the treated case. The derivation clarifies the assumptions underlying various specific functional forms for the treatment cost function. An empirical application to the treatment of breast cancer is provided, producing evidence on an important issue in the economics of screening programs, viz. whether detection of breast cancer at an earlier stage results in treatment cost savings.;J Health Econ. 1995 Aug.14(3):361-85.;Butler JR1, Furnival CM, Hart RF.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Australia/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/therapy*,Cost Savings,Cost of Illness*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Disease Progression*,Female,Hospital Costs,Humans,Mammography/economics,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Multivariate Analysis,Predictive Value of Tests;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Estimating the costs of cervical cancer screening in high-burden Sub-Saharan African countries.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate the capital investment and recurrent costs of national cervical cancer screening and precancer treatment programs in 23 high-incidence countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in order to provide estimates of the investment required to tackle the burden of cervical cancer in this region. These 23 countries account for 64% of the annual cervical cancer deaths in this region. METHODS: Secondary data were used to estimate the financial costs of equipment purchases and economic costs of screening and treating eligible women over a 10-year period. Screening would be by visual inspection with acetic acid and treatment by cryotherapy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure. RESULTS: Approximately US $59 million would be required to purchase treatment equipment if cryotherapy were placed at every screening facility. Approximately 20 million women would be screened over 10 years. Cost per woman screened in a screen-and-treat program was either US $3.33 or US $7.31, and cost per woman treated was either US $38 or US $71 depending on the location of cryotherapy equipment. CONCLUSION: It would take less than US $10 per woman screened to significantly decrease the cervical cancer deaths that will occur in Sub-Saharan Africa over the next 10 years.

1;Estimating screening test sensitivity and tumour progression using tumour size and time since previous screening.;Abstract As mammography screening aims to improve the prognosis through earlier detection/treatment, tumour progression and screening test sensitivity (STS) represent key parameters in the evaluation of screening programs. We will here study some methods for estimation of tumour progression and STS, and show how previously used methods can be combined and developed to utilise more of the data available in modern screening programs. Weedon-Fekjaer et al. recently suggested a study design using interview data about time since previous screening to estimate tumour progression and STS in a stepwise Markov model. While useful, the approach does not utilise tumour size measurements, nor link tumour progression to tumour size. Hence, we will here propose formulas for estimating tumour progression and STS using a continuous tumour growth model. To estimate tumour progression and STS, tumour growth curves are followed from one screening to the next, and probabilities for all combinations of tumour sizes at repeated screening examinations calculated. Based on the probabilities for screening detection on subsequent screening examinations, maximum likelihood estimates are calculated. Applied to Norwegian data, the new approach gives similar results to previously published results based on interval data, confirming the earlier estimated large variation in tumour growth rates.;Stat Methods Med Res. 2010 Oct.19(5):507-27. doi: 10.1177/0962280209359860.

0;Estimating progression rates for human papillomavirus infection from epidemiological data.;Abstract A Markov model was constructed in order to estimate type-specific rates of cervical lesion progression and regression in women with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). The model was fitted to age- and type-specific data regarding the HPV DNA and cytological status of women undergoing cervical screening in a recent screening trial, as well as cervical cancer incidence. It incorporates different assumptions about the way lesions regress, the accuracy of cytological screening, the specificity of HPV DNA testing, and the age-specific prevalence of HPV infection. Combinations of assumptions generate 162 scenarios for squamous cell carcinomas and 54 scenarios for adenocarcinomas. Simulating an unscreened cohort of women infected with high-risk HPV indicates that the probability of an infection continuing to persist and to develop into invasive cancer depends on the length of time it has already persisted. The scenarios and parameter sets that produce the best fit to available epidemiological data provide a basis for modeling the natural history of HPV infection and disease.;Med Decis Making. 2010 Jan-Feb.30(1):84-98. doi: 10.1177/0272989X09336140.

0;Estimating mean sojourn time and screening test sensitivity in breast cancer mammography screening: new results.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To assess if new screening techniques, increased use of hormone replacement therapy, or the transition from breast cancer screening trials to large scale screening programmes may influence the average time in preclinical screening detectable phase (mean sojourn time [MST]) or screening test sensitivity (STS). SETTING: Screening and interval data for 395,188 women participating in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Programme (NBCSP). METHODS: Weighted non-linear least-square regression estimates using a tree step Markov chain model, and a sensitivity analysis of the possible impact by opportunistic screening between ordinary breast cancer screening rounds. RESULTS: MST was estimated to 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.1-7.0) years for women aged 50-59 years, and 7.9 (95% CI 6.0-7.9) years for those aged 60-69 years. Correspondingly, STS was estimated to 58% (95% CI 52-64 %) and 73 % (67-78 %), respectively. Simulations revealed that opportunistic screening may give a moderate estimation bias towards higher MST and lower STS. Assuming a probable 21% higher background incidence, due to increased hormone replacement therapy use, MST estimates decreased to 3.9 and 5.0 years for the two age groups, and STS increased to 75 and 85%. CONCLUSIONS: The new estimates indicate that screening detectable phase is longer than that found in previous mammography trials/programmes, but also that the sensitivity of the screening test is lower. Overall, the NBCSP detects more cancer cases than most previous trials/programmes.;J Med Screen. 2005.12(4):172-8.;Weedon-Fekjaer H1, Vatten LJ, Aalen OO, Lindqvist B, Tretli S.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Early Diagnosis,Female,Humans,Mammography/methods*,Mammography/standards*,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/standards*,Middle Aged,Norway/epidemiology,Sensitivity and Specificity,Time Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Estimating mean sojourn time and screening sensitivity using questionnaire data on time since previous screening.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Mean sojourn time (MST) and screening test sensitivity (STS), is usually estimated by Markov models using incidence data from the first screening round and the interval between screening examinations. However, several screening programmes do not have full registration of cancers submerging after screening, and increased use of opportunistic screening over time can raise questions regarding the quality of interval cancer registration. Methods/settings Based on the earlier used Markov model, formulas for expected number of cases given time since former screening activity was developed. Using questionnaire data for 336,533 women in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Programme (NBCSP), mean square regression estimates of MST and STS were calculated. RESULTS: In contrast to the previously used method, the new approach gave satisfactory model fit. MST was estimated to 5.6 years for women aged 50-59 years, and 6.9 years for women aged 60-69 years, and STS was estimated to 55% and 60%, respectively. Attempts to add separate parameters for breast cancer incidence without screening, or previous STS, resulted in wide confidence intervals if estimated separately, and non-identifiably if combined. CONCLUSION: Previously published results of long MST and low screen test sensitivity were confirmed with the new approach. Questionnaire data on time since previous screening can be used to estimate MST and STS, but the approach is sensitive to relaxing the assumptions regarding the expected breast cancer incidence without screening and constant STS over time.;J Med Screen. 2008.15(2):83-90. doi: 10.1258/jms.2008.007071.;Weedon-Fekjaer H1, Lindqvist BH, Vatten LJ, Aalen OO, Tretli S.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/standards,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Norway/epidemiology,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,Surveys and Questionnaires*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Estimating life expectancy and related probabilities in screen-detected breast cancer patients with restricted follow-up information.;Abstract Issues such as life expectancy after diagnosis, the number of life years gained by early diagnosis through screening, the probability of dying from breast cancer or of dying from other causes during the lead time period or thereafter can be derived from information on complete survival after diagnosis. A method is presented to estimate complete survival and relevant outcomes after diagnosis of screen-detected cancer when the follow-up period is substantially shorter than the maximum follow-up possible. Survival after diagnosis until death from breast cancer is modelled as the sum of the lead time (LT) and the post-lead time (PLT), where both time periods follow exponential distributions and are assumed to be independent. The survival period after diagnosis until death from causes other than breast cancer (X) is assumed to follow a Gompertz distribution. The survival period after diagnosis until death from any cause (Z) is modelled as the minimum of LT+PLT and X. Maximum likelihood methods were then used to estimate all parameters of Z. This procedure for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of Z does not need the cause of death (breast cancer or other), which is an advantage over most other methods. Especially in older patients, it may be difficult or even impossible to ascertain the true cause of death. The model was applied to data from the long-term breast cancer screening programme in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Complete survival was estimated on the basis of survival data on 528 screen-detected breast cancer patients, diagnosed in 1975-1997 and with a mean follow-up of 8.9 years. Estimated life expectancy ranged between 22.3 and 9.0 years for patients diagnosed at the age of 50 and 79 years, respectively, that is, 6.1 and 0.7 life years gained by screening. Through early diagnosis and treatment, screen-detected patients diagnosed at the age of 50 years may have reduced their lifetime risk of dying from breast cancer from 79 per cent to 56 per cent. at the age of 79 the reduction of risk is reduced from 23 per cent to 13 per cent.;Stat Med. 2004 Feb 15.23(3):431-48.;Straatman H1, Verbeek AL, Peer PG, Borm G.;Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Life Expectancy*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Survival Analysis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Estimating benefits of screening from observational cohort studies.;Abstract Analysis and interpretation of observational studies of screening effectiveness is difficult because several biases threaten validity, including the structural healthy screenee bias, length bias, and effects of lead time. Although methods for the analysis of observational studies of screening effectiveness have been proposed, most have limitations such as incomplete control of length bias, or a heavy reliance on distributional assumptions. In this report we present a method for the analysis of observational cohort studies of screening effectiveness. Although developed independently and formulated specifically for estimating benefits of screening, our approach is implied by a more general approach developed previously by Robins. Our approach, in contrast to other available methods, avoids the healthy screenee bias, and length and lead time bias, and allows an empirical approach to analysis that need not depend highly on distributional assumptions. We illustrate application of the approach with analysis of published data from a study of breast cancer screening.;Stat Med. 1990 Aug.9(8):969-80.;Flanders WD1, Longini IM Jr.;Bias*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Cohort Studies*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Models, Statistical,Probability,Random Allocation,Reproducibility of Results,Risk Factors,Survival Analysis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Estimating asymptomatic duration in cancer: the AIDS connection.;Abstract Many chronic diseases, including AIDS and cancer, do not manifest themselves clinically until some time after their inception. In studies of disease natural history, the duration of the asymptomatic period is of interest-in AIDS, to predict the epidemic's course, and in cancer, to develop efficient screening strategies. This article provides a bridge between the two fields with respect to estimation of the asymptomatic period. By adapting AIDS methodology to cancer, the article identifies a non-parametric method for estimating the duration of the asymptomatic period in cancer. The method is similar to one developed by Louis et al. (Mathematical Biosciences, 40, 111-144 (1978)), and is designed to apply to data from a cohort of individuals, screened periodically. After reviewing the similarities and differences between the AIDS and cancer contexts, we develop an EM algorithm that, at convergence, yields a maximum or saddle point of the likelihood. We investigate the performance of the algorithm by means of a simulation study, explore the effect of adding a smoothing step to the estimation procedure, and adapt the method for use with a data set in which disease prevalence is low. We apply the method to data from the HIP breast cancer screening trial.;Stat Med. 1997 Mar 30.16(6):627-44.;Etzioni R1, Shen Y.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/diagnosis*,Algorithms*,Chronic Disease,Cohort Studies,Disease Progression*,Humans,Likelihood Functions*,Mass Screening,Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Reproducibility of Results,Statistics, Nonparametric*,Time Factors,5-PO1-CA53996-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,N01-CN-0523/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence in individuals with gastroesophageal reflux: synthesis and estimates from population studies.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Recent advances in the management of Barrett's esophagus may kindle enthusiasm for screening for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are recognized as relative risks for EAC. However, the absolute incidence of EAC in specific populations with GERD is unknown. We aimed to estimate the symptom-, age-, and sex-specific incidences of EAC, and place these incidences in the perspective of other cancers for which screening is endorsed. METHODS: A Markov computer model utilizing published and publicly available data was created to estimate the age- and sex-specific incidences of EAC in American white non-Hispanics with GERD symptoms. RESULTS: The incidence of EAC in men younger than 50 years with GERD symptoms is very low (for instance, at the age of 35 years, incidence=1.0/100,000), and their incidence of colorectal cancer is relatively much higher (for instance, at the age of 35 years, incidence of colorectal cancer is 6.7-fold greater). The incidence of EAC in older men with weekly GERD symptoms is substantial (for instance, at the age of 70 years, incidence=60.8/100,000 person-years), but their incidence of colorectal cancer is at least threefold greater. The incidence of EAC in women with GERD is extremely low, and similar to that of breast cancer in men (for instance, 3.9/100,000 person-years at the age of 60 years). CONCLUSIONS: Screening for EAC should not be performed in men younger than 50 years or in women because of very low incidences of cancer, regardless of the frequency of GERD symptoms. In white men with weekly GERD over the age of 60 years, the incidence of EAC is substantial, and might warrant screening if that practice is particularly accurate, safe, effective, and inexpensive.;Am J Gastroenterol. 2011 Feb.106(2):254-60. doi: 10.1038/ajg.2010.470.

0;Epitope mapping of prostate-specific antigen with monoclonal antibodies.;Abstract Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a widely used marker for screening and monitoring prostate cancer. We identified and characterized the epitopes of two anti-PSA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) designated B80 and B87. The epitopes were initially mapped as nonoverlapping by developing a sandwich immunoassay to measure PSA with the two anti-PSA mAbs. The two antibodies do not cross-react with homologous pancreatic kallikrein, but recognize epitopes unique to PSA. B80 and B87 can recognize both free and complexed PSA and hence measure total PSA. Epitope scanning and bacteriophage peptide library affinity selection procedures were used to identify and locate an epitope on PSA. A possible epitope for B80 was identified as being located on or near PSA amino acid residues 50-58 (-GRH-SLFHP-). The epitope for B87 was likely on an exposed nonlinear conformational determinant, unique to PSA, and not masked by the binding of B80 or alpha 1-antichymotrypsin.;Clin Chem. 1996 Dec.42(12):1961-9.;Jette DC1, Kreutz FT, Malcolm BA, Wishart DS, Noujaim AA, Suresh MR.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Amino Acid Sequence,Antibodies, Monoclonal*,Bacteriophages/chemistry,Chymotrypsin/analysis,Computer Simulation,Epitope Mapping/methods*,Epitopes/analysis,Humans,Male,Models, Molecular,Peptide Fragments/analysis,Peptide Fragments/chemistry,Prostate-Specific Antigen/analysis,Prostate-Specific Antigen/chemistry,Prostate-Specific Antigen/immunology*,Prostatic Neoplasms/immunology*,Tumor Cells, Cultured,Antibodies, Monoclonal,Epitopes,Peptide Fragments,Chymotrypsin,Prostate-Specific Antigen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Epidemiology of cervical cancer in Taiwan.;Abstract Because the prevalence of several risk factors for cervical cancer, including sexual behavior, reproductive patterns, contraceptive use, and cigarette smoking, has changed significantly over time among Taiwanese women, it is of interest to analyze the impact of these trends on the incidence and mortality rates for this cancer during the decades between 1970 and 1990. The number of deaths from cervical cancer was obtained from the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health during the period from 1974 to 1992. Data of all incident cervical cancer cases from 1979 through 1990 obtained from the Taiwan Cancer Registry were also used for the analyses. The trends in the age-adjusted and age-specific rates were examined. Age, period, and cohort effects on the incidence and mortality rates were also examined, using age-period-cohort (APC) models. The age-adjusted mortality rate has been increasing since the 1970s, particularly in both the youngest group (20-29 years) and the oldest group (65 years and over). While the age-adjusted incidence rate decreased from 1979 to 1990, and decreases were apparent across all broad age groups, nevertheless, the incidence of adenocarcinoma was moderating during the same time period. The APC models disclosed a decreasing cohort effect for the mortality and incidence rates among women born after 1936. Decreasing incidence rates after menopause were more consistent with a hormonal effect than a cohort effect. Declining trends in cervical cancer incidence may be related to the screening practices which may have counteracted the increasing prevalence of several risk factors, although poor survival influenced the incidence/mortality differentials for cervical cancer. Continued surveillance is warranted. however, attention might be directed to the trends in cervical adenocarcinoma.;Gynecol Oncol. 1996 Sep.62(3):344-52.;Wang PD1, Lin RS.;Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Linear Models,Middle Aged,Prevalence,Registries,Taiwan/epidemiology,Time Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Epidemiology and survival of cervical cancer in the French West-Indies: data from the Martinique Cancer Registry (2002-2011).;Abstract BACKGROUND: The Caribbean ranks seventh among world regions most affected by cervical cancer. Social health inequalities, such as differences in access to screening services, engender disparities in incidence and mortality between low- and middle-income countries and industrialized countries. The French National Cancer Plan 2014-2019 focuses on reducing inequalities in cervical cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the geographical distribution and overall survival of cervical cancer, based on data from a population-based cancer registry in Martinique (French West-Indies). METHODS: We included all cases of cervical cancer diagnosed between 2002 and 2011. The geographical distribution was described by zone of residence and by aggregated units for statistical information (IRIS). Based on the results of the model, standardized incidence rates (SIRs) were calculated using a Gamma Poisson model. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the risk factors for cervical cancer mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1253 cases were analyzed (947 in situ tumors and 306 invasive cancers). 1230 cases with geolocalization were used to map the distribution of the incidence of in situ and invasive cervical cancers. Five IRIS were significantly over-incident. The 5-year overall survival rate was 55%, with a median survival of 6.5 years [95% CI: 4.9-10.1]. Multivariate analysis confirmed age at diagnosis (HR = 2.15 [1.50-3.09]. p < 0.0001), FIGO stage (HR = 3.53 [2.50-4.99]. p < 0.0001) and zone of residence (HR = 1.51 [1.06-2.13]. p = 0.02) as risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Prognostic factors suggest that cervical cancer needs to be diagnosed at an early stage. Our results could allow cervical cancer screening programs to clearly identify geographical areas that would benefit from targeted interventions with a view to reducing incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in the Caribbean.;Glob Health Action. 2017.10(1):1337341. doi: 10.1080/16549716.2017.1337341.;Melan K1, Janky E2, Macni J3, Ulric-Gervaise S3, Dorival MJ4, Veronique-Baudin J3, Joachim C3.;Adult,Aged,Caribbean Region/epidemiology,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Humans,Incidence,Martinique/epidemiology,Middle Aged,Multivariate Analysis,Proportional Hazards Models,Registries,Residence Characteristics,Risk Factors,Survival Rate,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/ethnology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Ensemble of convolutional neural networks for classification of breast microcalcification from mammograms.;Abstract Human level recall performance in detecting breast cancer considering microcalcifications from mammograms has a recall value between 74.5% and 92.3%. In this research, we approach to breast microcalcification classification problem using convolutional neural networks along with various preprocessing methods such as contrast scaling, dilation, cropping etc. and decision fusion using ensemble of networks. Various experiments on Digital Database for Screening Mammography dataset showed that preprocessing poses great importance on the classification performance. The stand-alone models using the dilation and cropping preprocessing techniques achieved the highest recall value of 91.3%. The ensembles of the stand-alone models surpass this recall value and a 97.3% value of recall is achieved. The ensemble having the highest F1 Score (harmonic mean of precision and recall), which is 94.5%, has a recall value of 94.0% and a precision value of 95.0%. This recall is still above human level performance and the models achieve competitive results in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score measures.;Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc. 2017 Jul.2017:689-692. doi: 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8036918.;Sert E, Ertekin S, Halici U.;Breast Diseases*,Calcinosis,Humans,Mammography,Neural Networks (Computer)*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Elucidation of relationship between tumor size and survival in non-small-cell lung cancer patients can aid early decision making in clinical drug development.;Abstract Four non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) registration trials were utilized to develop models linking survival to risk factors and changes in tumor size during treatment. The purpose was to leverage existing quantitative knowledge to facilitate future development of anti-NSCLC drugs. Eleven risk factors were screened using a Cox model. A mixed exponential decay and linear growth model was utilized for modeling tumor size. Survival times were described in a parametric model. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score and baseline tumor size were consistent prognostic factors of survival. Tumor size was well described by the mixed model. The parametric survival model includes ECOG score, baseline tumor size, and week 8 tumor size change as predictors of survival duration. The change in tumor size at week 8 allows early assessment of the activity of an experimental regimen. The survival model and the tumor model will be beneficial for early screening of candidate drugs, simulating NSCLC trials, and optimizing trial designs.;Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2009 Aug.86(2):167-74. doi: 10.1038/clpt.2009.64.

0;Eliciting willingness to pay: comparing closed-ended with open-ended and payment scale formats.;Abstract Willingness to pay (WTP) is increasingly being used as a measure of valuation in health technology assessment. A variety of formats for eliciting values are available, although the relative virtues of each remain the subject of methodological controversy. This article compares valuation results obtained using a WTP survey instrument in a closed-ended format with those obtained from instruments using open-ended and payment scale formats. Samples of subjects were drawn from a general population, and all were asked to value the same intervention--alternative methods of screening for colorectal cancer. It was discovered that, whereas the open-ended and payment scale formats produced broadly similar valuations, the closed-ended format produced significantly higher WTP valuations and different justifications for those valuations. It is hypothesized that anchoring and yea-saying effects explain these differences and that the closed-ended format triggers a different response mode in subjects.;Med Decis Making. 2003 Mar-Apr.23(2):150-9.;Frew EJ1, Whynes DK, Wolstenholme JL.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Validation Studies,Attitude to Health,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Educational Status,Female,Financing, Personal*,Health Expenditures*,Humans,Linear Models,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Econometric,Occult Blood,Odds Ratio,Research Design,Sex Factors,Surveys and Questionnaires/standards*,United Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Electrical impedance spectroscopy of benign and malignant prostatic tissues.;Abstract PURPOSE: The specificity of current screening methods for prostate cancer is limited and it results in approximately 75% to 80% of patients who undergo biopsy having findings negative for cancer. We used electrical impedance spectroscopy to evaluate how significantly the electrical properties of benign and malignant prostatic tissues differ with the goal of providing clinicians with a new biomarker to aid in diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected freshly excised prostates from 14 men immediately following radical prostatectomy. The prostates were sectioned into 3 mm slices. Electrical property measurements of conductivity and relative permittivity were recorded from each slice using a coaxially configured probe over the frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz. The area probed was marked so that following tissue fixation and slide preparation histological assessment could be correlated directly with the recorded electrical impedance spectroscopy spectra. RESULTS: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, nonhyperplastic glandular tissue and stroma were the primary tissue types probed with electrical impedance spectroscopy. Conductivity ranged from 0.093 S/m at 1 kHz to 0.277 S/m at 1 MHz. Relative permittivity ranged from 8.5 x 10(5) at 1 kHz down to 1.3 x 10(3) at 1 MHz. There were significant conductivity differences between cancer and stroma at all frequencies (p <0.01). There were significant permittivity differences between cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia at frequencies greater that 92 kHz (p <0.01). Significant correlations were observed between electrical properties, and the concentration of stromal and glandular tissues present in the tissue area histologically assessed. CONCLUSIONS: The electrical properties of benign and malignant prostate tissues differ significantly. This should be considered for use as a diagnostic tool. The differences observed between cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia are especially important since current screening methods do not reliably differentiate between the 2 conditions.;J Urol. 2008 Apr.179(4):1580-6. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2007.11.043.

1;Efficacy of breast-cancer screening for female relatives of breast-cancer-index cases: Taiwan multicentre cancer screening (TAMCAS).;Abstract Although the efficacy of mass screening for breast cancer has been established in Western countries, this strategy may be too costly for other countries with low incidence rates of breast cancer. We propose an alternative approach to screen female relatives of breast-cancer-index cases from hospitals, as part of the Taiwan multicentre cancer screening (TAMCAS) project. In order to assess the efficacy of this programme, and to estimate how often this high-risk group should be screened, we firstly elucidated the disease natural history from the pre-clinical screen-detectable phase (PCDP) by estimating the relevant parameters based on Markov chain models. We further predicted the proportion of interval cancers, advanced breast tumours and deaths from breast cancers by different screening frequencies. Results showed that the estimate of mean sojourn time (MST) for this high-risk group (1.9 years. 95% CI.1.18-4.86) is shorter than that for females from the general population. Analysis of a surrogate endpoint based on regional lymph-node spread and tumour size shows that annual screening for this high-risk group is likely to confer a significant 33% reduction in breast-cancer mortality compared with a non-significant 25 and 20% reduction for 2 yearly and 3-yearly screening regimes respectively. The above results suggest that a 1-year interval might be appropriate for this high-risk group. A simple cost-effectiveness analysis indicates a cost per year of life saved for mass screening ($72,480) 15 times that for the high-risk group ($4,851 ).;Int J Cancer. 1998 Sep 25.78(1):21-6.;Lai MS1, Yen MF, Kuo HS, Koong SL, Chen TH, Duffy SW.;Multicenter Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Family Health*,Female,Humans,Incidence,Lymphatic Metastasis,Mass Screening/standards*,Program Evaluation,Taiwan/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Effects of study methods and biases on estimates of invasive breast cancer overdetection with mammography screening: a systematic review.;Abstract Estimates of breast-cancer overdetection, the detection with screening of cancer that would not have presented clinically during the woman's lifetime (and therefore would not be diagnosed in the absence of screening), vary widely. We systematically reviewed estimates of overdetection to assess the extent to which these might be biased by study methods. Primary research papers and reviews that estimated overdetection of invasive breast cancer were eligible for inclusion. For each paper we appraised the study design and methods to identify the extent and effect of bias. Two reviews and six primary studies were included. We categorised studies as being based on cumulative-incidence or incidence-rate methods. The least biased overdetection estimates range from -4% to 7.1% for women aged 40-49 years, 1.7% to 54% for women aged 50-59 years, and 7% to 21% for women aged 60-69 years. Studies consistently show that cancer overdetection occurs in screening for breast cancer. however, reported estimates are biased. Sensitivity of mammography for both cancers that will progress and for overdetected cancers may be increasing with time. New studies are urgently needed to quantify the true extent of overdetection in current mammography screening programmes. These studies should be designed to avoid the multiple sources of bias identified in this review.;Lancet Oncol. 2007 Dec.8(12):1129-1138. doi: 10.1016/S1470-2045(07)70380-7.;Biesheuvel C1, Barratt A2, Howard K2, Houssami N2, Irwig L2.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Review,Adult,Age Distribution,Age Factors,Aged,Bias,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Epidemiologic Research Design,Female,Humans,Incidence,Mammography*/statistics & numerical data,Mass Screening/methods*,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Neoplasm Invasiveness,Predictive Value of Tests,Risk Assessment,Sensitivity and Specificity,Time Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Effects of mammography screening under different screening schedules: model estimates of potential benefits and harms.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Despite trials of mammography and widespread use, optimal screening policy is controversial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate U.S. breast cancer screening strategies. DESIGN: 6 models using common data elements. DATA SOURCES: National data on age-specific incidence, competing mortality, mammography characteristics, and treatment effects. TARGET POPULATION: A contemporary population cohort. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: 20 screening strategies with varying initiation and cessation ages applied annually or biennially. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of mammograms, reduction in deaths from breast cancer or life-years gained (vs. no screening), false-positive results, unnecessary biopsies, and overdiagnosis. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The 6 models produced consistent rankings of screening strategies. Screening biennially maintained an average of 81% (range across strategies and models, 67% to 99%) of the benefit of annual screening with almost half the number of false-positive results. Screening biennially from ages 50 to 69 years achieved a median 16.5% (range, 15% to 23%) reduction in breast cancer deaths versus no screening. Initiating biennial screening at age 40 years (vs. 50 years) reduced mortality by an additional 3% (range, 1% to 6%), consumed more resources, and yielded more false-positive results. Biennial screening after age 69 years yielded some additional mortality reduction in all models, but overdiagnosis increased most substantially at older ages. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Varying test sensitivity or treatment patterns did not change conclusions. LIMITATION: Results do not include morbidity from false-positive results, patient knowledge of earlier diagnosis, or unnecessary treatment. CONCLUSION: Biennial screening achieves most of the benefit of annual screening with less harm. Decisions about the best strategy depend on program and individual objectives and the weight placed on benefits, harms, and resource considerations.

1;Effectiveness of early detection on breast cancer mortality reduction in Catalonia (Spain).;Abstract BACKGROUND: At present, it is complicated to use screening trials to determine the optimal age intervals and periodicities of breast cancer early detection. Mathematical models are an alternative that has been widely used. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of different breast cancer early detection strategies in Catalonia (Spain), in terms of breast cancer mortality reduction (MR) and years of life gained (YLG), using the stochastic models developed by Lee and Zelen (LZ). METHODS: We used the LZ model to estimate the cumulative probability of death for a cohort exposed to different screening strategies after T years of follow-up. We also obtained the cumulative probability of death for a cohort with no screening. These probabilities were used to estimate the possible breast cancer MR and YLG by age, period and cohort of birth. The inputs of the model were: incidence of, mortality from and survival after breast cancer, mortality from other causes, distribution of breast cancer stages at diagnosis and sensitivity of mammography. The outputs were relative breast cancer MR and YLG. RESULTS: Relative breast cancer MR varied from 20% for biennial exams in the 50 to 69 age interval to 30% for annual exams in the 40 to 74 age interval. When strategies differ in periodicity but not in the age interval of exams, biennial screening achieved almost 80% of the annual screening MR. In contrast to MR, the effect on YLG of extending screening from 69 to 74 years of age was smaller than the effect of extending the screening from 50 to 45 or 40 years. CONCLUSION: In this study we have obtained a measure of the effect of breast cancer screening in terms of mortality and years of life gained. The Lee and Zelen mathematical models have been very useful for assessing the impact of different modalities of early detection on MR and YLG in Catalonia (Spain).;BMC Cancer. 2009 Sep 15.9:326. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-326.;Rue M1, Vilaprinyo E, Lee S, Martinez-Alonso M, Carles MD, Marcos-Gragera R, Pla R, Espinas JA.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Effectiveness of cervical cancer screening over cervical cancer mortality among Japanese women.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Various studies have revealed that cervical cancer (CC) screening significantly reduces both CC incidence and mortality in developed countries. Although Japan introduced a nationwide government funded annual CC screening for the women aged 30+ in 1982, the effectiveness of CC screening on CC mortality has not yet been evaluated by any prospective cohort study. Therefore, the present study evaluated the association of CC mortality with self-reported CC screening and some other factors by a nationwide cohort study. METHODS: Baseline survey of the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for the enrollment of subjects was completed during 1988-90 and followed until 2003. This study only analyzed 63,541 women, aged 30-79 years, who were free from any cancer history at enrollment. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 38 CC deaths were identified. The mean age at mortality was 67.0 years, with a mortality rate of 4.2 per 100,000 person-years. Participation rate in CC screening was 46.9%. Age-adjusted Cox model indicated significantly lower CC mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.12-0.74] due to CC screening. Protectiveness remained almost the same (HR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.12-0.76) when adjusted for age, body mass index and number of deliveries. The results also revealed that CC screening could reduce at least 50% of CC deaths even after excluding the effect of possible self-selection bias. CONCLUSIONS: CC screening in Japan may reduce CC mortality significantly for women aged 30-79 years. However, further studies with more CC deaths and increased statistical power are needed to validate the findings.;Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2006 Aug.36(8):511-8.

0;Effect of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA '88) on the incidence of invasive cervical cancer.;Abstract The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 (CLIA '88) mandates strict, new quality-control measures for laboratories that interpret cervical cytology smears. Proposed regulations include proficiency testing of cytotechnologists and remediation for technologists and laboratories that fail to meet proposed proficiency standards. Proponents of the new regulations argue that these measures will reduce deaths from cervical cancer by reducing the false-negative rate of the Papanicolaou (Pap) test, but opponents argue that the regulations will increase the price of processing Pap tests and thereby reduce access to cervical cancer screening for high-risk, vulnerable populations. To examine these claims the authors used David Eddy's published simulation to model the natural history and detection of cervical neoplasia, and developed a new model to examine the health consequences of diminished access to Pap testing. The authors estimated the false-negative rate of the Pap test and the price elasticity of demand for preventive services on the basis of the published literature, and modeled the entire range of published or quoted predictions about the impact of CLIA '88 on accuracy and price. The results show that, if effects on access are ignored, reducing the false-negative rate from 15% to 5% would prevent 66 invasive cancers per 100,000 average risk women screened. However, under moderate assumptions regarding the effect of price on access, the regulations would prevent only 11 (instead of 66) cancers per 100,000 eligible women. The regulatory effect is very sensitive to the degree of improvement in the false-negative rate and increase in price that the regulations cause. Over the range of assumptions and predictions encountered in the literature and tested in our analysis, the proposed regulations could greatly reduce or greatly increase the incidence of invasive cancer, especially among high-risk and uninsured women. The implementation of the regulations should be delayed until new information regarding the actual false-negative rate of the Pap test allow a more precise estimate of the potential impact on the incidence of cervical cancer.;Med Care. 1992 Dec.30(12):1067-82.;Helfand M1, O'Connor GT, Zimmer-Gembeck M, Beck JR.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Clinical Competence/standards,Clinical Laboratory Techniques/standards*,False Negative Reactions,Female,Health Care Costs,Health Services Accessibility/economics,Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data*,Health Services Research,Humans,Incidence,Laboratories/legislation & jurisprudence*,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/standards*,Medically Uninsured/statistics & numerical data,Models, Statistical,Papanicolaou Test*,Patient Dropouts/statistics & numerical data,Reproducibility of Results,Risk Factors,Sensitivity and Specificity,United States/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,Vaginal Smears/economics,Vaginal Smears/standards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Effect of prediagnostic alcohol consumption on survival after breast cancer in young women.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption has been comprehensively investigated as an etiologic risk factor for breast cancer but has received little attention in terms of its effect on prognosis after breast cancer, particularly for young women. METHODS: 1,286 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at age < or =45 years from two population-based case-control studies in the Seattle-Puget Sound region were followed from their diagnosis of breast cancer (between January 1983 and December 1992) for survival through June 2002, during which time 364 women had died. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the effect of prediagnostic alcohol consumption on the risk of dying. RESULTS: After adjusting for age and diagnosis year, compared with nondrinkers, women who consumed alcohol in the 5 years before diagnosis had a decreased risk of death [>0 to <3 drinks per week: hazard ratio, 0.7. 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.6-0.95. 3 to <7 drinks per week: risk ratio, 0.6. 95% CI, 0.4-0.8.7 drinks per week: risk ratio, 0.7. 95% CI, 0.5-0.9]. This association was unchanged on additional adjustment for potential confounders including most notably treatment, stage at diagnosis, and mammogram history. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that women who consume alcohol before a diagnosis of breast cancer have improved survival, which does not appear to be attributable to differences in stage, screening, or treatment.;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2008 Aug.17(8):1988-96. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2897.

0;Effect of cost sharing on screening mammography in Medicare health plans.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Policies that increase patients' share of health care expenses decrease the use of discretionary health services but also may reduce the use of important preventive care such as mammography. METHODS: We reviewed coverage for mammography within 174 Medicare managed-care plans from 2001 through 2004. Among 550,082 individual-level observations for 366,475 women between the ages of 65 and 69 years, we compared rates of biennial breast-cancer screening in plans requiring cost sharing for mammography with screening rates in plans with full coverage. We also performed a longitudinal analysis of screening rates in plans that changed from full coverage to cost sharing for mammography as compared with rates in matched control plans that did not institute cost sharing. RESULTS: The number of plans with cost sharing for mammography, which we defined as requiring a copayment of more than $10 or coinsurance of more than 10% for screening mammography, increased from 3 in 2001 (representing 0.5% of women) to 21 in 2004 (11.4% of women). Biennial screening rates were 8.3 percentage points lower in cost-sharing plans than in plans with full coverage, a difference that persisted in adjusted analyses (P<0.001). The effect of cost sharing was magnified among women residing in areas of lower income or educational levels (P<0.001 for each interaction). Screening rates decreased by 5.5 percentage points in plans that instituted cost sharing and increased by 3.4 percentage points in matched control plans that retained full coverage (P<0.001 for the adjusted analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Relatively small copayments were associated with significantly lower mammography rates among women who should undergo screening mammography according to accepted clinical guidelines. For effective preventive services such as mammography, exempting elderly adults from cost sharing may be warranted.

0;Effect of comprehensive breast care on breast cancer outcomes: a community hospital based study from Mumbai, India.;Abstract Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women in India and the disease burden is increasing annually. The lack of awareness initiatives, structured screening, and affordable treatment facilities continue to result in poor survival. We present a breast cancer survival scenario, in urban population in India, where standardised care is distributed equitably and free of charge through an employees' healthcare scheme. We studied 99 patients who were treated at our hospital during the period 2005 to 2010 and our follow-up rates were 95.95%. Patients received evidence-based standardised care in line with the tertiary cancer centre in Mumbai. One-, three- and five-year survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Socio-demographic, reproductive and tumor factors, relevant to survival, were analysed. Mortality hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox proportional hazard method. Survival in this series was compared to that in registries across India and discrepancies were discussed. Patients mean age was 56 years, mean tumor size was 3.2 cms, 85% of the tumors belonged to T1 and T2 stages, and 45% of the patients belonged to the composite stages I and IIA. Overall 5-year survival was 74.9%. Patients who presented with large-sized tumors (HR 3.06. 95% CI 0.4-9.0), higher composite stage (HR 1.91. 0.55-6.58) and undergone mastectomy (HR 2.94. 0.63- 13.62) had a higher risk of mortality than women who had higher levels of education (HR 0.25. 0.05-1.16), although none of these results reached the significant statistical level. We observed 25% better survival compared to other Indian populations. Our results are comparable to those from the European Union and North America, owing to early presentation, equitable access to standardised free healthcare and complete follow-up ensured under the scheme. This emphasises that equitable and affordable delivery of standardised healthcare can translate into early presentation and better survival in India.;Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2012.13(4):1105-9.;Gadgil A1, Roy N, Sankaranarayanan R, Muwonge R, Sauvaget C.;Adult,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy*,Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/pathology*,Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating/therapy*,Educational Status,Evidence-Based Medicine,Female,Health Services Accessibility*/economics,Hospitals, Community,Humans,India,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Mastectomy,Menopause,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Proportional Hazards Models,Survival Rate,Tumor Burden,Urban Population;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1;Economic evaluation of the breast cancer screening programme in the Basque Country: retrospective cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer screening in the Basque Country has shown 20 % reduction of the number of BC deaths and an acceptable overdiagnosis level (4 % of screen detected BC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the breast cancer early detection programme in the Basque Country in terms of retrospective cost-effectiveness and budget impact from 1996 to 2011. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was built to reproduce the natural history of breast cancer (BC). We estimated for lifetime follow-up the total cost of BC (screening, diagnosis and treatment), as well as quality-adjusted life years (QALY), for women invited to participate in the evaluated programme during the 15-year period in the actual screening scenario and in a hypothetical unscreened scenario. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated with the use of aggregated costs. Besides, annual costs were considered for budget impact analysis. Both population level and single-cohort analysis were performed. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was applied to assess the impact of parameters uncertainty. RESULTS: The actual screening programme involved a cost of 1,127 million euros and provided 6.7 million QALYs over the lifetime of the target population, resulting in a gain of 8,666 QALYs for an additional cost of 36.4 million euros, compared with the unscreened scenario. Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 4,214€/QALY. All the model runs in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio lower than 10,000€/QALY. The screening programme involved an increase of the annual budget of the Basque Health Service by 5.2 million euros from year 2000 onwards. CONCLUSIONS: The BC screening programme in the Basque Country proved to be cost-effective during the evaluated period and determined an affordable budget impact. These results confirm the epidemiological benefits related to the centralised screening system and support the continuation of the programme.;BMC Cancer. 2016 Jun 1.16:344. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2386-y.;Arrospide A1,2,3, Rue M4,5, van Ravesteyn NT6, Comas M4,7, Soto-Gordoa M8, Sarriugarte G9, Mar J8,10,4,11.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Retrospective Studies,Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Economic evaluation of strategies for managing women with equivocal cytological results in Brazil.;Abstract In Brazil, current management of women with screening results of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) is to offer repeat testing at 6-month intervals. Alternative management strategies that have been adopted in many high-income settings are to offer immediate colposcopy referral or to utilise human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing as a triage for colposcopy referral, and to consider different strategies according to women's age. The objective of our study was to evaluate the lifetime cost effectiveness in terms of cost per years of life saved (YLS) of these alternative strategies for a middle income setting. A Markov model was developed using data from the Ludwig-McGill cohort and calibrated to independent observational datasets and local cost estimates obtained. In the base-case analysis, repeat cytology was the least costly strategy but also the least effective. Based on the WHO threshold for very cost-effective interventions, HPV triage for women above 30 years-old was the strategy with the highest probability of being cost effective. HPV triage including younger women with ASCUS results would also be a cost-effective option. Whilst there was a slight further gain in effectiveness with immediate colposcopy referral, it was also more expensive and did not appear to be cost effective. Threshold analysis indicated that an HPV test would have to be more than twice as expensive as a cytology test for HPV triage to no longer be cost effective. In conclusion, our results indicate that in middle income settings HPV triage is likely to be the optimal strategy for managing women presenting with ASC-US results.;Int J Cancer. 2011 Aug 1.129(3):671-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25708.

1;Do women >or=50 years of age need as much screening as women <50 years after they have had negative screening results?;Abstract To assess the adequacy of a routine screening to identify cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 or worse (CIN2+) in women over 50 years of age, a retrospective cohort was set in six Italian organised population-based screening programmes. In all, 287 330 women (1 714 550 person-years of observation, 1110 cases) screened at age 25-64, with at least two cytological screening tests, the first negative, were followed from their first negative smear until a biopsy proven CIN2+ lesion or their last negative smear. For women aged 25-49 and 50-64 years, crude and age-standardised detection rate (DR), cumulative risk (CR), adjusted hazard risk for number of previous negative screens, probability of false-positive CIN2+ after two or more smear tests were calculated. Detection rate is significantly lower over 50 years of age. Multivariable analysis shows a significant protective effect from four screening episodes (DR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.51-0.97). the effect of age >or=50 is 0.29 (95% CI: 0.24-0.35). The CR of CIN2+ is at least eightfold higher in women <50 (CR=2.06, 95% CI: 1.88-2.23) after one previous negative test than in women >or=50 years with four screens (CR=0.23, 95% CI: 0.00-0.46). Over 50 years of age, after four tests at least three false-positive cases are diagnosed for every true positive. Benefits arising from cytological screening is uncertain in well-screened older women.;Br J Cancer. 2008 Jul 22.99(2):239-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604455.

0;Disparities in cervical cancer mortality rates as determined by the longitudinal hyperbolastic mixed-effects type II model.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The main purpose of this study was to model and analyze the dynamics of cervical cancer mortality rates for African American (Black) and White women residing in 13 states located in the eastern half of the United States of America from 1975 through 2010. METHODS: The cervical cancer mortality rates of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) were used to model and analyze the dynamics of cervical cancer mortality. A longitudinal hyperbolastic mixed-effects type II model was used to model the cervical cancer mortality data and SAS PROC NLMIXED and Mathematica were utilized to perform the computations. RESULTS: Despite decreasing trends in cervical cancer mortality rates for both races, racial disparities in mortality rates still exist. In all 13 states, Black women had higher mortality rates at all times. The degree of disparities and pace of decline in mortality rates over time differed among these states. Determining the paces of decline over 36 years showed that Tennessee had the most rapid decline in cervical cancer mortality for Black women, and Mississippi had the most rapid decline for White Women. In contrast, slow declines in cervical cancer mortality were noted for Black women in Florida and for White women in Maryland. CONCLUSIONS: In all 13 states, cervical cancer mortality rates for both racial groups have fallen. Disparities in the pace of decline in mortality rates in these states may be due to differences in the rates of screening for cervical cancers. Of note, the gap in cervical cancer mortality rates between Black women and White women is narrowing.;PLoS One. 2014 Sep 16.9(9):e107242. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0107242. eCollection 2014.;Tabatabai MA1, Kengwoung-Keumo JJ2, Eby WM3, Bae S4, Guemmegne JT5, Manne U6, Fouad M4, Partridge EE7, Singh KP4.;Historical Article,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,African Americans,Algorithms,Appalachian Region/epidemiology,Appalachian Region/ethnology,European Continental Ancestry Group,Female,History, 20th Century,History, 21st Century,Humans,Models, Statistical,Mortality,SEER Program,Southeastern United States/epidemiology,Southeastern United States/ethnology,Texas/epidemiology,Texas/ethnology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/history,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality,P30 CA013148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,G12 MD007586/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States,U54 CA118623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U54 MD008176/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States,2U54-CA118948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,P20 MD006899/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States,U54MD008176/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States,P50CA098252/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Digoxin use and risk of invasive breast cancer: evidence from the Nurses' Health Study and meta-analysis.;Abstract Despite preclinical evidence supporting anti-cancer effects of cardiac glycosides, epidemiologic studies consistently show elevated breast cancer risk in digoxin users. We studied this association in the Nurses' Health Study cohort to evaluate influences of screening mammography and lifestyle-related risk factors. We followed 90,202 postmenopausal women from 1994 to 2010. Self-reported breast cancers were confirmed by medical record review. We fit Cox regression models to estimate associations between time-varying digoxin use and breast cancer incidence, overall and by tumor ER status, accounting for mammography screening and established breast cancer risk factors. There were 5,004 digoxin users over 1.05 million person-years of observation, among whom 144 breast cancer cases occurred. Digoxin users were more likely to undergo mammographic screening, to be former users of postmenopausal hormones, and to take other medications than never-users. the groups were similar on reproductive history and alcohol consumption. Current digoxin use of >4-year duration was associated with a 45 % increased rate of breast cancer compared with never use (HRadj = 1.45, 95 % CI 1.13-1.86). The association appeared stronger for ER-positive disease (HRadj = 1.46, 95 % CI 1.10-1.95) than for ER-negative disease (HRadj = 1.12, 95 % CI 0.52-2.37). Associations were robust to restriction on regular mammography use and to adjustment for established breast cancer risk factors, including lifestyle-related exposures. The positive association between digoxin use and breast cancer occurrence was not attenuated when lifestyle-related breast cancer risk factors and screening practices were accounted for. Digoxin, a common cardiac drug worldwide, may promote breast carcinogenesis.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2014 Apr.144(2):427-35. doi: 10.1007/s10549-014-2886-x.

0;Differential diagnosis of breast lesions by use of biomagnetic activity and non-linear analysis.;Abstract PURPOSE: Breast cancer mortality rates have not changed during the past 60 years despite significant advances in screening methods. It is tempting therefore to use novel technology in order to better understand breast oncology. In this study we investigated the biomagnetic activity obtained in benign and malignant breast lesions using a single channel biomagnetometer SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) in order to assess the method's efficacy in the differential diagnosis of these two types of lesions and its establishment as a screening technique. METHOD: Magnetic recordings were obtained from 21 patients with palpable breast lumps. Of these 11 were invasive carcinomas and 10 were benign breast lesions. We used non-linear analysis to investigate whether there is any biological differentiation in the dynamics in these two types of lesions. RESULTS: High amplitudes characterized the waveform of a malignant breast lesion whereas in benign breast lesions the corresponding amplitudes were low. Using the application of non-linear analysis we observed a clear saturation value for the dimension of malignant breast lesions and no saturation for benign ones. DISCUSSION: Biomagnetic measurements with the SQUID and the application of non-linear analysis are promising procedures in assessing and differentiating breast tumors.;Eur J Gynaecol Oncol. 2000.21(6):591-5.;Anninos PA1, Kotini A, Koutlaki N, Adamopoulos A, Galazios G, Anastasiadis P.;Adult,Breast Diseases/diagnosis*,Breast Diseases/pathology,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Diagnosis, Differential,Female,Humans,Magnetics*,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Nonlinear Dynamics*,Predictive Value of Tests;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Differences in Patient Outcomes of Prevalence, Interval, and Screen-Detected Lung Cancers in the CT Arm of the National Lung Screening Trial.;Abstract Lung cancer screening identifies cancers with heterogeneous behaviors. Some lung cancers will be identified among patients who had prior negative CT screens and upon follow-up scans develop a de novo nodule that was determined to be cancerous. Other lung cancers will be identified among patients who had one or more prior stable positive scans that were not determined to be lung cancer (indeterminate pulmonary nodules), but in follow-up scans was diagnosed with an incidence lung cancer. Using data from the CT arm of the National Lung Screening Trial, this analysis investigated differences in patient characteristics and survival endpoints between prevalence-, interval-, and screen-detected lung cancers, characterized based on sequence of screening results. Lung cancers immediately following a positive baseline (T0), and prior to the T1 screen, formed the prevalence cohort. Interval cancers were diagnosed following a negative screen at any time point prior to the next screening round. Two cohorts of screen-detected lung cancers (SDLC) were identified that had a baseline positive screen that was that was not determined to be lung cancer (i.e., an indeterminate pulmonary nodule), but in follow-up scans was diagnosed with an incidence lung cancer 12 (SDLC1) or 24 (SDLC2) months later. Two other incidence cohorts had screen-detected lung cancers that had baseline negative screen and upon follow-up scans developed a de novo nodule determined to be cancerous at 12 (SDLC3) or 24 (SDLC4) months later. Differences in patient characteristics, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. The lung cancer-specific death rate was higher for SDLC3/SDLC4 compared to SDLC1/SDLC2 lung cancers (136.6/1,000 person-years vs. 71.3/1,000 person-years, P < 0.001). Moreover, PFS and OS were significantly lower for SDLC3/SDLC4 compared to SDLC1/SDLC2 (P < 0.004. P < 0.002, respectively). The findings were consistent when stratified by stage and histology. Multivariable Cox proportional models revealed that the SDLC3/SDLC4 case groups were associated with significantly poorer PFS (HR = 1.89. 95% CI 1.31-2.74) and OS (HR = 1.80. 95% CI 1.21-2.67) compared to SDLC1/SDLC2 lung cancers (HR = 1.00). Lung cancer patients who develop a de novo nodule that determined to be cancerous (i.e., at least one negative CT screen prior to cancer diagnosis) had poorer survival outcomes compared to patients who had at least one positive screen prior to cancer diagnosis. As such, the observation that de novo screen-detected are associated with poorer survival could be attributed to faster growing, more aggressive cancers that arose from a lung environment previously lacking focal abnormalities.;PLoS One. 2016 Aug 10.11(8):e0159880. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0159880. eCollection 2016.;Schabath MB1, Massion PP2, Thompson ZJ3, Eschrich SA4, Balagurunathan Y5, Goldof D6, Aberle DR7, Gillies RJ5.;Aged,Demography,Disease-Free Survival,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Humans,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Lung Neoplasms/mortality,Lung Neoplasms/pathology,Male,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Prevalence,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk,Smoking,Tomography, X-Ray Computed*,P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA143062/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA152662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA186145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Diagnostic validity of fecal occult blood tests for detecting gastroenterological cancers.;Abstract In order to estimate the diagnostic validity of chemical fecal occult blood tests, i.e. orthotolidine (Shionogi A) and guajac (Shionogi B) slides for detecting cancers of the esophagus, stomach and colorectum, the authors followed up all the examinees (n = 3,449) of comprehensive medical check-ups at the Center for Adult Diseases, Osaka, by means of record linkage to the Osaka Cancer Registry's files. Then, diagnostic validity was calculated based on the results of two years' follow-up. Sensitivity for the respective cancers was 20.0%, 11.8% and 62.5% for Shionogi A, and 20.0%, 5.9% and 43.8% for Shionogi B slides. Likelihood ratio for the respective cancers was 1.4, 0.8 and 4.5 for Shionogi A, and 3.3, 1.0 and 7.5 for Shionogi B. Specificity was analogous among the three cancer sites, being 86% for Shionogi A and 94% for Shionogi B. These results suggest that the diagnostic validity of chemical occult blood tests for detecting cancers of the esophagus and the stomach is very poor, and therefore imply that close examinations of these sites for screening positives is unnecessary in mass screenings for colorectal cancer.;Jpn J Cancer Res. 1992 Feb.83(2):141-5.;Murakami R1, Otani T, Nakanishi K, Fudemoto Y, Ishikawa H, Hiyama T, Tsukuma H, Fujimoto I, Miki N, Oshima A.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Esophageal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Japan,Likelihood Functions,Male,Middle Aged,Occult Blood*,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,Stomach Neoplasms/diagnosis*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Diagnostic parameters in liquid-based cervical cytology using a coagulant suspension fixative.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in detail the morphology of cervical cell samples suspended in the coagulant fixative BoonFix (Finetec, Tokyo, Japan) in liquid-based Papspin slides (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.A) to detect shifts in diagnostic parameters for infections and neoplasia. STUDY DESIGN: Split samples of 1,010 cases were collected. All Papspin slides were scanned with neural network technology. In 849 cases the diagnosis was within normal limits. in 22 cases it was preneoplasia. In 151 special cases conventional smears were compared with thin-layer slides. RESULTS: In 85% of the 151 special cases, a shift of the diagnostic parameter was observed in the Papspin slide. The parameter adhesion of inflammatory cells to epithelial cells was easier to discern in 94% of the cases, and adhesion of microorganisms varied 43-100%. Koilocytosis was more visible in 79%. Prominent nucleoli in atypical and malignant cells were enhanced in 50-100% of cases with preneoplasia. The fact that the cells on the Papspin slide were no longer present in diagnostic streaks posed a problem only in the case of follicular cervicitis. CONCLUSION: The shifts in parameters facilitated the diagnostic process. BoonFix permits the screening of liquid-based Papspin slides, which have proven to be well suited to automated neural network scanning.;Acta Cytol. 2005 Sep-Oct.49(5):513-9.;Boon ME1, Ouwerkerk-Noordam E, Suurmeijer AJ, Kok LP.;Evaluation Studies,Bacterial Infections/pathology,Carcinoma/pathology*,Cervix Uteri/microbiology,Cervix Uteri/pathology,Epithelial Cells/microbiology,Epithelial Cells/pathology,Female,Fixatives*,Humans,Infection/pathology*,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/trends,Mycoses/pathology,Neural Networks (Computer),Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods,Precancerous Conditions/pathology*,Predictive Value of Tests,Protozoan Infections/pathology,Reproducibility of Results,Tissue Fixation/methods*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology*,Vaginal Smears/methods*,Fixatives;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Diagnosis by Volatile Organic Compounds in Exhaled Breath from Lung Cancer Patients Using Support Vector Machine Algorithm.;Abstract Monitoring exhaled breath is a very attractive, noninvasive screening technique for early diagnosis of diseases, especially lung cancer. However, the technique provides insufficient accuracy because the exhaled air has many crucial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at very low concentrations (ppb level). We analyzed the breath exhaled by lung cancer patients and healthy subjects (controls) using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and performed a subsequent statistical analysis to diagnose lung cancer based on the combination of multiple lung cancer-related VOCs. We detected 68 VOCs as marker species using GC/MS analysis. We reduced the number of VOCs and used support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify the samples. We observed that a combination of five VOCs (CHN, methanol, CH₃CN, isoprene, 1-propanol) is sufficient for 89.0% screening accuracy, and hence, it can be used for the design and development of a desktop GC-sensor analysis system for lung cancer.;Sensors (Basel). 2017 Feb 4.17(2). pii: E287. doi: 10.3390/s17020287.;Sakumura Y1, Koyama Y2, Tokutake H3, Hida T4, Sato K5, Itoh T6, Akamatsu T7, Shin W8.;Algorithms,Breath Tests,Exhalation,Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry,Humans,Lung Neoplasms*,Support Vector Machine,Volatile Organic Compounds,Volatile Organic Compounds;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Diagnosing lung cancer in exhaled breath using gold nanoparticles.;Abstract Conventional diagnostic methods for lung cancer are unsuitable for widespread screening because they are expensive and occasionally miss tumours. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry studies have shown that several volatile organic compounds, which normally appear at levels of 1-20 ppb in healthy human breath, are elevated to levels between 10 and 100 ppb in lung cancer patients. Here we show that an array of sensors based on gold nanoparticles can rapidly distinguish the breath of lung cancer patients from the breath of healthy individuals in an atmosphere of high humidity. In combination with solid-phase microextraction, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to identify 42 volatile organic compounds that represent lung cancer biomarkers. Four of these were used to train and optimize the sensors, demonstrating good agreement between patient and simulated breath samples. Our results show that sensors based on gold nanoparticles could form the basis of an inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tool for lung cancer.;Nat Nanotechnol. 2009 Oct.4(10):669-73. doi: 10.1038/nnano.2009.235.

0;Development of Wagle Health-Specific Religiousness scale.;Abstract African American women have a lower rate of regular mammography screening, resulting in higher incidence of advanced-stage breast cancer at diagnosis and a lower 5-year survival rate as compared with white women. Researchers have demonstrated that several health beliefs relate to mammography screening in African American women, but little attention has been paid to the importance of religiousness. Although some authors have attempted to determine a link between religiousness and health, we lack a valid and reliable instrument to measure religiousness that can be found in the context of health behaviors. The purpose of this article is to describe the development and psychometric testing of the Wagle Health-Specific Religiousness (WHSR) scale, an instrument used to measure religious beliefs and the influence of those beliefs on mammography screening for African American women. A sample of 344 low-income African American women who were nonadherent to mammography at accrual participating in a randomized trial completed the WHSR. Data from this trial were used to determine the validity and reliability of the WHSR. The 19-item WHSR scale had a Cronbach alpha of. 94. Construct validity was supported via factor analysis and analysis of theoretical relationships. Although further testing is warranted, this analysis indicates that the concept of religiousness is an important component of mammography behavior in African American women.;Cancer Nurs. 2009 Sep-Oct.32(5):418-25. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0b013e3181aaf0dd.;Wagle AM1, Champion VL, Russell KM, Rawl SM.;Validation Studies,Adult,African Americans/statistics & numerical data*,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Female,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice*,Humans,Linear Models,Mammography/statistics & numerical data*,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data*,Poverty,Program Development*,Psychometrics,Religion*,Reproducibility of Results,Socioeconomic Factors,United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Development of new non-invasive tests for colorectal cancer screening: the relevance of information on adenoma detection.;Abstract Researchers are actively pursuing the development of a new non-invasive test (NIT) for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening as an alternative to fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs). The majority of pilot studies focus on the detection of invasive CRC rather than precursor lesions (i.e., adenomas). We aimed to explore the relevance of adenoma detection for the viability of an NIT for CRC screening by considering a hypothetical test that does not detect adenomas beyond chance. We used the Simulation Model of Colorectal Cancer (SimCRC) to estimate the effectiveness of CRC screening and the lifetime costs (payers' perspective) for a cohort of US 50-years-old persons to whom CRC screening is offered from age 50-75. We compared annual screening with guaiac and immunochemical FOBTs (with sensitivities up to 70 and 24% for CRC and adenomas, respectively) to annual screening with a hypothetical NIT (sensitivity of 90% for CRC, no detection of adenomas beyond chance, specificity and cost similar to FOBTs). Screening with the NIT was not more effective, but was 29-44% more costly than screening with FOBTs. The findings were robust to varying the screening interval, the NIT's sensitivity for CRC, adherence rates favoring the NIT, and the NIT's unit cost. A comparative modelling approach using a model that assumes a shorter adenoma dwell time (MISCAN-COLON) confirmed the superiority of the immunochemical FOBT over an NIT with no ability to detect adenomas. Information on adenoma detection is crucial to determine whether a new NIT is a viable alternative to FOBTs for CRC screening. Current evidence thus lacks an important piece of information to identify marker candidates that hold real promise and deserve further (large-scale) evaluation.;Int J Cancer. 2015 Jun 15.136(12):2864-74. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29343.

0;Development of a nomogram to predict probability of positive initial prostate biopsy among Japanese patients.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Several nomograms for prostate cancer detection have recently been developed. Because the incidence of prostate cancer is lower among Asian men, nomograms based on Western populations cannot be directly applied to Japanese men. We, therefore, developed a model for predicting the probability of a positive initial prostate biopsy using clinical and laboratory data from a Japanese male population. METHODS: Data were collected from 834 Japanese male referrals who underwent initial prostate biopsies as individual screening. We analyzed age, total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, free/total PSA (f/t PSA) ratio, prostate volume, and digital rectal examination findings. Of these data, we randomly reserved 20% for study validation. Logistic regression analysis estimated relative risk, 95% confidence intervals, and P values. RESULTS: Independent predictors of a positive biopsy result included elevated PSA levels, decreased f/T PSA ratio, advanced age, small prostate volume, and abnormal digital rectal examination findings. We developed a predictive nomogram for an initial positive biopsy using these variables. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the model was 81.8%, which was significantly greater than that of the prediction based on PSA alone (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 67.8%). If externally validated, applying this model could reduce unnecessary biopsy procedures by 32% and reduce the overall need for prostate biopsies by 26%. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of a Japanese population, incorporating clinical and laboratory data into a prebiopsy nomogram significantly improved the prediction of prostate cancer compared with predictions based solely on the individual factors.;Urology. 2006 Jan.67(1):131-6.;Suzuki H1, Komiya A, Kamiya N, Imamoto T, Kawamura K, Miura J, Suzuki N, Nakatsu H, Hata A, Ichikawa T.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Biopsy,Humans,Japan,Male,Nomograms*,Predictive Value of Tests,Prostate/pathology*,Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Developing a risk prediction model for breast cancer: a Statistical Utility to Determine Affinity of Neoplasm (SUDAN-CA Breast).;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer risk prediction models are widely used in clinical settings. Although most of the well-known models were designed based on data collected from western population, yet they have been utilized for surveillance purposes in many limited-resource countries. Given the genetic variations in risk factors that exist between different races, we therefore aimed to develop and validate a tool for breast cancer risk assessment among Sudanese women. METHODS: Using cross-sectional design, 153 subjects were eligible to participate in our study. Data were collected from the only couple of tertiary centers in Sudan. They underwent multiple logistic regression using purposeful selection method to build the model. Various adjustments were made to determine significant predictors. Overall performance, calibration and discrimination were assessed by R 2, O/E ratio and c-statistic, respectively. RESULTS: SUDAN predictors of breast cancer were: age, menarche, family history, vegetables and fruits weekly servings, and type of cereals that traditional cuisine is made of. Both Nagelkerke R 2 (0.495) and O/E ratio (0.78) were good. c-statistic expressed the excellent discriminatory power of the model (0.864, p < 0.001, 95% CI 0.81-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that SUDAN provides a simple, efficient and well-calibrated tool to predict and classify women's lifetime risks of developing breast cancer. Input from our model could be deployed to guide utilization of the more advanced screening modalities in resource-limited settings to maximize cost effectiveness. Consequently, this might improve the stage at which the diagnosis is usually made.;Eur J Med Res. 2017 Sep 29.22(1):35. doi: 10.1186/s40001-017-0277-6.;Salih AM1,2,3, Alam-Elhuda DM4, Alfaki MM5,6, Yousif AE7, Nouradyem MM8.;Multicenter Study,Observational Study,Adult,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Risk;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Detection of lung cancer in exhaled breath with an electronic nose using support vector machine analysis.;Abstract Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies and has a low 5-year survival rate. There are no cheap, simple and widely available screening methods for the early diagnostics of lung cancer. The aim of this study was to determine whether analysis of exhaled breath with an artificial olfactory sensor using support vector analysis can differentiate patients with lung cancer from healthy individuals and patients with other lung diseases, regardless of the stage of lung cancer and the most common comorbidities. Patients with histologically or cytologically verified lung cancer, healthy volunteers and patients with other lung diseases (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, benign lung tumors) were enrolled in the study. Breath sample collection and analysis with a Cyranose 320 sensor device was performed and data were further analyzed using a support vector machine (SVM). The SVM correctly differentiated between cancer patients and healthy volunteers in 98.8% of cases. The cancer versus non-cancer group patients (healthy volunteers and patients with other lung diseases) were classified correctly by SVM in 87.3% of cases. In the mixed diagnosis groups (only cancer, only COPD, cancer + COPD and control) all 79 out of 79 patients were predicted correctly in the cancer + COPD group, with the rate of correct prognosis in other patient groups being lower. Exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose using a SVM is able to discriminate patients with lung cancer from healthy subjects and mixed groups of patients with different lung diseases. It can also provide a certain level of discrimination between lung cancer patients, lung cancer patients with concomitant COPD, COPD alone and a healthy control group.;J Breath Res. 2017 Aug 21.11(3):036009. doi: 10.1088/1752-7163/aa7799.;Tirzīte M1, Bukovskis M, Strazda G, Jurka N, Taivans I.;Adult,Aged,Breath Tests/methods*,Case-Control Studies,Electronic Nose*,Exhalation*,Female,Healthy Volunteers,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Lung Neoplasms/pathology,Male,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/diagnosis,Support Vector Machine*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Detection of breast abnormalities using a prototype resonance electrical impedance spectroscopy system: a preliminary study.;Abstract Electrical impedance spectroscopy has been investigated with but limited success as an adjunct procedure to mammography and as a possible pre-screening tool to stratify risk for having or developing breast cancer in younger women. In this study, the authors explored a new resonance frequency based [resonance electrical impedance spectroscopy (REIS)] approach to identify breasts that may have highly suspicious abnormalities that had been recommended for biopsies. The authors assembled a prototype REIS system generating multifrequency electrical sweeps ranging from 100 to 4100 kHz every 12 s. Using only two probes, one in contact with the nipple and the other with the outer breast skin surface 60 mm away, a paired transmission signal detection system is generated. The authors recruited 150 women between 30 and 50 years old to participate in this study. REIS measurements were performed on both breasts. Of these women 58 had been scheduled for a breast biopsy and 13 had been recalled for additional imaging procedures due to suspicious findings. The remaining 79 women had negative screening examinations. Eight REIS output signals at and around the resonance frequency were computed for each breast and the subtracted signals between the left and right breasts were used in a simple jackknifing method to select an optimal feature set to be inputted into a multi-feature based artificial neural network (ANN) that aims to predict whether a woman's breast had been determined as abnormal (warranting a biopsy) or not. The classification performance was evaluated using a leave-one-case-out method and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. The study shows that REIS examination is easy to perform, short in duration, and acceptable to all participants in terms of comfort level and there is no indication of sensation of an electrical current during the measurements. Six REIS difference features were selected as input signals to the ANN. The area under the ROC curve (A(z)) was 0.707 +/- 0.033 for classifying between biopsy cases and non-biopsy (including recalled and screening negative) and the performance (A(z)) increased to 0.746 +/- 0.033 after excluding recalled but negative cases. At 95% specificity, the sensitivity levels were approximately 20.5% and 30.4% in the two data sets tested. The results suggest that differences in REIS signals between two breasts measured in and around the tissue resonance frequency can be used to identify at least some of the women with suspicious abnormalities warranting biopsy with high specificity.;Med Phys. 2008 Jul.35(7):3041-8.;Zheng B1, Zuley ML, Sumkin JH, Catullo VJ, Abrams GS, Rathfon GY, Chough DM, Gruss MZ, Gur D.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Biopsy,Breast/pathology*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Electric Impedance*,Female,Humans,Mammography/methods,Medical Oncology/methods,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Neural Networks (Computer),ROC Curve,Risk,Spectrum Analysis/methods*,R21 CA127169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,1R21CA127169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Detection methods predict differences in biology and survival in breast cancer patients.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to measure the biological characteristics involved in tumorigenesis and the progression of breast cancer in symptomatic and screen-detected carcinomas to identify possible differences. METHODS: For this purpose, we evaluated clinical-pathological parameters and proliferative and apoptotic activities in a series of 130 symptomatic and 161 screen-detected tumors. RESULTS: After adjustment for the smaller size of the screen-detected carcinomas compared with symptomatic cancers, those detected in the screening program presented longer disease-free survival (RR = 0.43, CI = 0.19-0.96) and had high estrogen and progesterone receptor concentrations more often than did symptomatic cancers (OR = 3.38, CI = 1.72-6.63 and OR = 3.44, CI = 1.94-6.10, respectively). Furthermore, the expression of bcl-2, a marker of good prognosis in breast cancer, was higher and HER2/neu expression was lower in screen-detected cancers than in symptomatic cancers (OR = 1.77, CI = 1.01-3.23 and OR = 0.64, CI = 0.40-0.98, respectively). However, when comparing prevalent vs incident screen-detected carcinomas, prevalent tumors were larger (OR = 2.84, CI = 1.05-7.69), were less likely to be HER2/neu positive (OR = 0.22, CI = 0.08-0.61) and presented lower Ki67 expression (OR = 0.36, CI = 0.17-0.77). In addition, incident tumors presented a shorter survival time than did prevalent ones (RR = 4.88, CI = 1.12-21.19). CONCLUSIONS: Incident carcinomas include a variety of screen-detected carcinomas that exhibit differences in biology and prognosis relative to prevalent carcinomas. The detection method is important and should be taken into account when making therapy decisions.;BMC Cancer. 2012 Dec 17.12:604. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-12-604.;Redondo M1, Funez R, Medina-Cano F, Rodrigo I, Acebal M, Tellez T, Roldan MJ, Hortas ML, Bellinvia A, Pereda T, Domingo L, Morales-Suarez Varela M, Sala M, Rueda A.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Case-Control Studies,Disease Progression,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Humans,Immunohistochemistry,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Mammography*,Middle Aged,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Detecting early breast tumour by finite element thermal analysis.;Abstract Thermography has been proved to be an effective technique for indicating breast disease abnormalities or risks. However, the abnormalities might not express clearly due to various factors, such as when a small tumour is located in a deep region, or environmental influences that make breast disease difficult to find. This study aims to solve these problems for early detection of breast tumour. A three-dimensional breast model is presented to investigate the relationship between an embedded tumour and the surface temperature distribution. Then a subtraction technique is used to enhance the thermal signature of breast tumour. It was showed that the surface thermal characteristics of a small tumour even in a deep region could be found easily by this method. Furthermore, it was also found that the surface thermal characteristics of tumour obscured due to environmental cooling effect can be clearly displayed. The results are very useful for analysing breast thermograms.;J Med Eng Technol. 2009.33(4):274-80. doi: 10.1080/03091900802106638.;Lin QY1, Yang HQ, Xie SS, Wang YH, Ye Z, Chen SQ.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Computer Simulation,Early Detection of Cancer*,Female,Finite Element Analysis*,Humans,Models, Biological,Subtraction Technique,Temperature,Thermography/methods*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Detecting cancer clusters in a regional population with local cluster tests and Bayesian smoothing methods: a simulation study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: There is a rising public and political demand for prospective cancer cluster monitoring. But there is little empirical evidence on the performance of established cluster detection tests under conditions of small and heterogeneous sample sizes and varying spatial scales, such as are the case for most existing population-based cancer registries. Therefore this simulation study aims to evaluate different cluster detection methods, implemented in the open source environment R, in their ability to identify clusters of lung cancer using real-life data from an epidemiological cancer registry in Germany. METHODS: Risk surfaces were constructed with two different spatial cluster types, representing a relative risk of RR = 2.0 or of RR = 4.0, in relation to the overall background incidence of lung cancer, separately for men and women. Lung cancer cases were sampled from this risk surface as geocodes using an inhomogeneous Poisson process. The realisations of the cancer cases were analysed within small spatial (census tracts, N = 1983) and within aggregated large spatial scales (communities, N = 78). Subsequently, they were submitted to the cluster detection methods. The test accuracy for cluster location was determined in terms of detection rates (DR), false-positive (FP) rates and positive predictive values. The Bayesian smoothing models were evaluated using ROC curves. RESULTS: With moderate risk increase (RR = 2.0), local cluster tests showed better DR (for both spatial aggregation scales > 0.90) and lower FP rates (both < 0.05) than the Bayesian smoothing methods. When the cluster RR was raised four-fold, the local cluster tests showed better DR with lower FPs only for the small spatial scale. At a large spatial scale, the Bayesian smoothing methods, especially those implementing a spatial neighbourhood, showed a substantially lower FP rate than the cluster tests. However, the risk increases at this scale were mostly diluted by data aggregation. CONCLUSION: High resolution spatial scales seem more appropriate as data base for cancer cluster testing and monitoring than the commonly used aggregated scales. We suggest the development of a two-stage approach that combines methods with high detection rates as a first-line screening with methods of higher predictive ability at the second stage.;Int J Health Geogr. 2013 Dec 7.12:54. doi: 10.1186/1476-072X-12-54.;Lemke D1, Mattauch V, Heidinger O, Pebesma E, Hense HW.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Bayes Theorem,Cluster Analysis,Computer Simulation*,Female,Germany/epidemiology,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Male,Middle Aged,Population Surveillance/methods*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Designing and optimization of novel human LMTK3 inhibitors against breast cancer - a computational approach.;Abstract Estrogen receptor-α (ERα) is expressed more in patients with breast cancer and its level correlated with endocrine resistance. LMTK3 is reported as breast cancer target with regulation of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) through phosphorylation. In this computational study, structure-based inhibitor screening was performed on human LMTK3 using ZINC database. ATP-binding cavity with critical residues involved in the LMTK3 phosphorylation was used as target site for the screening. From the large ligand library, the best compounds were screen with three-phase virtual screening methods in Dockblaster, AutoDock Vina and AutoDock, respectively. The evaluation of ligands was carried out by binding energy and weak interactions, such as hydrogen bond interactions and hydrophobic contacts, in the target site that favors LMTK3 inhibition. Top compounds were found to be more effective in druglikeness activity by ADME prediction. The stability and binding affinity of ligand complexes were optimized by trajectory analysis such as RMSD, Rg, SASA and interhydrogen bonds from molecular dynamics simulations. The behavior of protein motion after ligand binding was illustrated by eigenvectors from principal component analysis (PCA). In addition, binding free energy of the LMTK3-ligand complexes were calculated by MM/PBSA methods and results supported the strong binding in dynamic system. Thus, the computational studies illustrated the structural insights on LMTK3 inhibition mechanism by ligands ZINC04670539, ZINC05607079 and ZINC04344028, also proposed as potent lead candidates. Our findings step towards developing novel LMTK3 inhibitors and identified lead candidates can be future breast cancer drugs with further experimental studies.;J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2017 Feb.37(1):51-59. doi: 10.3109/10799893.2016.1155069.

0;Design and benchtop validation of a handheld integrated dynamic breast imaging system for noninvasive characterization of suspicious breast lesions.;Abstract We have developed a portable, handheld, integrated, dynamic breast imaging system that integrates a near infrared tissue oximeter, clinical ultrasound, and two pressure sensors for noninvasive detection of pressure-induced structural and functional dynamics of suspicious breast lesions. A series of benchtop tests were conducted to validate multiple performance characteristics of the integrated dynamic near infrared/ultrasound breast imaging system (idNIRUS), including the reconstruction of the absorptive heterogeneities and the generation of the dynamic compression stimuli. In absorptive heterogeneity testing, we reconstructed the absorption coefficients of transparent polypropylene tubing circulated with a skim milk-India ink mixture and embedded in a gel wax tissue simulating phantom. High linear correlations (R(2) greater than 0.989) were observed between the reconstructed and the measured absorption coefficients of the embedded tubing. In dynamic compression testing, five volunteer operators generated ten successive compression sessions by compressing the idNIRUS imager on a breast self examination wearable model following the computer simulated pressure profile. The manually generated pressure profiles demonstrated an accuracy of 95.7% and operator-dependent variation of less than 5%. The results of the current benchtop tests will help to optimize the most appropriate testing conditions for our future planned clinical trial.;Technol Cancer Res Treat. 2008 Dec.7(6):471-81.;Xu RX1, Ewing J, El-Dahdah H, Wang B, Povoski SP.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Algorithms,Breast/pathology*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Computer Simulation,Computers,Computers, Handheld,Diagnostic Imaging/instrumentation,Diagnostic Imaging/methods,Early Detection of Cancer,Equipment Design,Female,Humans,Medical Oncology/methods,Pressure,Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared/methods,Ultrasonography/instrumentation,Ultrasonography/methods;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Defining and predicting indolent and low risk prostate cancer.;Abstract The early detection of asymptomatic prostate cancer has led to the increased incidence of tumours that are unlikely to become symptomatic during life, so called indolent cancers. The prediction of low risk and indolent prostate cancer is needed to avoid overtreatment by unnecessary invasive therapies, and select men for active surveillance. Some of the currently available nomograms predicting these low risk tumours have been validated in independent populations. However, assessment to the compliance with their treatment advises based on the calculation of probability are scarce. The ultimate value of nomograms for the urologic practice can only be assessed by analysing their practical implementation.;Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2012 Aug.83(2):235-41. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2011.10.003.

0;DeepPap: Deep Convolutional Networks for Cervical Cell Classification.;Abstract Automation-assisted cervical screening via Pap smear or liquid-based cytology (LBC) is a highly effective cell imaging based cancer detection tool, where cells are partitioned into abnormal and normal categories. However, the success of most traditional classification methods relies on the presence of accurate cell segmentations. Despite sixty years of research in this field, accurate segmentation remains a challenge in the presence of cell clusters and pathologies. Moreover, previous classification methods are only built upon the extraction of hand-crafted features, such as morphology and texture. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a method to directly classify cervical cells-without prior segmentation-based on deep features, using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). First, the ConvNet is pretrained on a natural image dataset. It is subsequently fine-tuned on a cervical cell dataset consisting of adaptively resampled image patches coarsely centered on the nuclei. In the testing phase, aggregation is used to average the prediction scores of a similar set of image patches. The proposed method is evaluated on both Pap smear and LBC datasets. Results show that our method outperforms previous algorithms in classification accuracy (98.3%), area under the curve (0.99) values, and especially specificity (98.3%), when applied to the Herlev benchmark Pap smear dataset and evaluated using five-fold cross validation. Similar superior performances are also achieved on the HEMLBC (H&E stained manual LBC) dataset. Our method is promising for the development of automation-assisted reading systems in primary cervical screening.;IEEE J Biomed Health Inform. 2017 Nov.21(6):1633-1643. doi: 10.1109/JBHI.2017.2705583.

0;Dedicated breast CT: radiation dose and image quality evaluation.;Abstract PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of breast computed tomography (CT) in terms of radiation dose and image quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Validated Monte Carlo simulation techniques were used to estimate the average glandular dose (AGD). The calculated photon fluence at the detector for high-quality abdominal CT (120 kVp, 300 mAs, 5-mm section thickness) was the benchmark for assessing the milliampere seconds and corresponding radiation dose necessary for breast CT. Image noise was measured by using a 10-cm-diameter cylinder imaged with a clinical CT scanner at 10-300 mAs for 80, 100, and 120 kVp. A cadaveric breast was imaged in the coronal plane to approximate the acquisition geometry of a proposed breast CT scanner. RESULTS: The AGD for 80-kVp breast CT was comparable to that for two-view mammography of 5-cm breasts (compressed breast thickness). For thicker breasts, the breast CT dose was about one-third less than that for two-view mammography. The maximum dose at mammography assessed in 1-mm(3) voxels was far higher (20.0 mGy) than that at breast CT (5.4 mGy) for a typical 5-cm 50% glandular breast. CT images of an 8-cm cadaveric breast (AGD, 6.3 mGy) were subjectively superior to digital mammograms (AGD, 10.1 mGy) of the same specimen. CONCLUSION: The potential of high signal-to-noise ratio images with low anatomic noise, which are obtainable at dose levels comparable to those for mammography, suggests that dedicated breast CT should be studied further for its potential in breast cancer screening and diagnosis.;Radiology. 2001 Dec.221(3):657-67.;Boone JM1, Nelson TR, Lindfors KK, Seibert JA.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Breast/radiation effects,Computer Simulation,Feasibility Studies,Female,Humans,In Vitro Techniques,Mammography*,Monte Carlo Method,Phantoms, Imaging,Radiation Dosage,Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed,Tomography, X-Ray Computed*,R21CA82077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Decline in age at menarche among Spanish women born from 1925 to 1962.;Abstract BACKGROUND: While the timing of reproductive events varies across populations, a downward trend in age at menarche has nevertheless been reported in most of the developed world over the past century. Given the impact of change in age at menarche on health conditions, this study sought to examine secular trends in age at menarche among women living in Navarre (Northern Spain) who participated in a population-based breast cancer screening programme. METHODS: The study was based on 110545 women born from 1925 to 1962. Trends were tested using a linear regression model, in which year of birth was entered continuously as the predictor and age at menarche (years) as the response variable, using size of town and region of birth as covariates. RESULTS: Among women born in Navarre between 1925 and 1962, age at menarche declined steadily from an average of 13.72 years in the 1925-1929 birth-cohorts to 12.83 years in the 1958-1962 birth-cohorts. Controlling for size of town or city of birth, age at menarche declined by an average of 0.132 years every 5 years over the period 1925-1962. This decline was greater in women born in rural versus urban settings. Trends were also different among regions of birth. CONCLUSION: We report a population-based study showing a downward trend in age of onset of menarche among Spanish women born in the period 1925-1962, something that is more pronounced among women born in rural settings and varies geographically.;BMC Public Health. 2009 Dec 4.9:449. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-9-449.;Cabanes A1, Ascunce N, Vidal E, Ederra M, Barcos A, Erdozain N, Lope V, Pollán M.;Adolescent,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Child,Cohort Effect,Female,Humans,Linear Models,Menarche/physiology*,Middle Aged,Residence Characteristics,Rural Population,Spain,Urban Population;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The structure was elucidated based on chemical evidence, 1D and 2D spectroscopic analyses as well as spectrometric techniques. The compound showed promising cytotoxic activity against breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The anticancer activity was explained via virtual docking of the isolated compound to the main sites in the human cyclin-dependent kinase2 (CDK2) crystal structure.;Nat Prod Res. 2016 Sep.30(18):2093-100. doi: 10.1080/14786419.2015.1114938.

0;Cumulative Incidence of Cancer Among Persons With HIV in North America: A Cohort Study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Cancer is increasingly common among persons with HIV. OBJECTIVE: To examine calendar trends in cumulative cancer incidence and hazard rate by HIV status. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design during 1996 to 2009. PARTICIPANTS: 86 620 persons with HIV and 196 987 uninfected adults. MEASUREMENTS: Cancer type-specific cumulative incidence by age 75 years and calendar trends in cumulative incidence and hazard rates, each by HIV status. RESULTS: Cumulative incidences of cancer by age 75 years for persons with and without HIV, respectively, were as follows: Kaposi sarcoma, 4.4% and 0.01%. non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 4.5% and 0.7%. lung cancer, 3.4% and 2.8%. anal cancer, 1.5% and 0.05%. colorectal cancer, 1.0% and 1.5%. liver cancer, 1.1% and 0.4%. Hodgkin lymphoma, 0.9% and 0.09%. melanoma, 0.5% and 0.6%. and oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer, 0.8% and 0.8%. Among persons with HIV, calendar trends in cumulative incidence and hazard rate decreased for Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For anal, colorectal, and liver cancer, increasing cumulative incidence, but not hazard rate trends, were due to the decreasing mortality rate trend (-9% per year), allowing greater opportunity to be diagnosed. Despite decreasing hazard rate trends for lung cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, and melanoma, cumulative incidence trends were not seen because of the compensating effect of the declining mortality rate. LIMITATION: Secular trends in screening, smoking, and viral co-infections were not evaluated. CONCLUSION: Cumulative cancer incidence by age 75 years, approximating lifetime risk in persons with HIV, may have clinical utility in this population.

0;Cultural affiliation and mammography screening of Chinese women in an urban county of Michigan.;Abstract The aim of this study is to explore the relationship of culturally based attitudes on breast cancer screening behavior of Chinese women currently residing in the United States. This cross-sectional study used a survey instrument that was administered to a consecutive nonprobability sample of 202 Chinese women residing in an urban Michigan county. Mood's strength of cultural affiliation scale (SCAS) was modified for cultural appropriateness prior to being translated into Chinese, back-translated, and pretested prior to use for this study. Data were analyzed using descriptive, correlational, and multivariate analysis techniques. Statistical analyses revealed that cultural diversity within the Chinese sample was associated with differing health behaviors and that the SCAS had indirect effects, through access to health care, on women's mammography screening use (R2 = 28.3%). These study's findings reveal that cultural affiliation and beliefs are related to the breast cancer screening behavior of immigrant Chinese women.;J Transcult Nurs. 2005 Apr.16(2):107-16.;Yu MY1, Wu TY, Mood DW.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Acculturation,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Asian Americans/education,Asian Americans/ethnology*,China/ethnology,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Health Behavior/ethnology,Health Care Surveys,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice,Health Services Accessibility,Hong Kong/ethnology,Humans,Linear Models,Mammography/psychology,Mammography/utilization*,Mass Screening/psychology,Mass Screening/utilization*,Michigan,Middle Aged,Models, Psychological,Multivariate Analysis,Patient Acceptance of Health Care/ethnology*,Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data,Self Concept,Social Identification*,Socioeconomic Factors,Surveys and Questionnaires,Taiwan/ethnology,Urban Population/statistics & numerical data,Women/education,Women/psychology*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Critical Analysis of Markov Models Used for the Economic Evaluation of Colorectal Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The economic evaluation of colorectal cancer screening is challenging because of the need to model the underlying unobservable natural history of the disease. OBJECTIVES: To describe the available Markov models and to critically analyze their main structural assumptions. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in eight relevant databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Econlit, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, Health Economic Evaluations Database, Health Technology Assessment database, Cost-Effective Analysis Registry, and European Network of Health Economics Evaluation Databases), identifying 34 models that met the inclusion criteria. A comparative analysis of model structure and parameterization was conducted using two checklists and guidelines for cost-effectiveness screening models. RESULTS: Two modeling techniques were identified. One strategy used a Markov model to reproduce the natural history of the disease and an overlaying model that reproduced the screening process, whereas the other used a single model to represent a screening program. Most of the studies included only adenoma-carcinoma sequences, a few included de novo cancer, and none included the serrated pathway. Parameterization of adenoma dwell time, sojourn time, and surveillance differed between studies, and there was a lack of validation and statistical calibration against local epidemiological data. Most of the studies analyzed failed to perform an adequate literature review and synthesis of diagnostic accuracy properties of the screening tests modeled. CONCLUSIONS: Several strategies to model colorectal cancer screening have been developed, but many challenges remain to adequately represent the natural history of the disease and the screening process. Structural uncertainty analysis could be a useful strategy for understanding the impact of the assumptions of different models on cost-effectiveness results.

1;Costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of breast cancer control in Ghana.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer control in Ghana is characterised by low awareness, late-stage treatment and poor survival. In settings with severely constrained health resources, there is a need to spend money wisely. To achieve this and to guide policy makers in their selection of interventions, this study systematically compares costs and effects of breast cancer control interventions in Ghana. METHODS: We used a mathematical model to estimate costs and health effects of breast cancer interventions in Ghana from the healthcare perspective. Analyses were based on the WHO-CHOICE method, with health effects expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), costs in 2009 US dollars (US$) and cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs) in US$ per DALY averted. Analyses were based on local demographic, epidemiological and economic data, to the extent these data were available. RESULTS: Biennial screening by clinical breast examination (CBE) of women aged 40-69 years, in combination with treatment of all stages, seems the most cost-effective intervention (costing $1299 per DALY averted). The intervention is also economically attractive according to international standards on cost-effectiveness. Mass media awareness raising (MAR) is the second best option (costing $1364 per DALY averted). Mammography screening of women of aged 40-69 years (costing $12,908 per DALY averted) cannot be considered cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Both CBE screening and MAR seem economically attractive interventions. Given the uncertainty about the effectiveness of these interventions, only their phased introduction, carefully monitored and evaluated, is warranted. Moreover, their implementation is only meaningful if the capacity of basic cancer diagnostic, referral and treatment and possibly palliative services is simultaneously improved. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Trop Med Int Health. 2012 Aug.17(8):1031-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.03021.x.

1;Costs and effectiveness of alternative strategies for cervical cancer screening in military beneficiaries.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential effects, on costs and outcomes, of changes in sensitivity and specificity associated with new screening methods for cervical cancer in the military. METHODS: A Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer was created to simulate a cohort of 100,000 military beneficiaries aged 18-85. Probability estimates for various outcomes and the accuracy of screening tests were obtained from the literature. Cost estimates were obtained from military sources where available. otherwise, civilian costs were used. The outcomes and costs of conventional cytology, liquid-based cytology, and liquid-based cytology with human papillomavirus (HPV) triage were compared at 1-, 2-, and 3-year screening frequencies. RESULTS: Marginal reductions in the incidence of cervical cancer from increasing screening sensitivity are greater than reductions in cancer mortality at every screening interval. Incremental improvements in both cancer incidence and mortality are higher at less frequent screening intervals. Increases in the ratio of low- to high-grade lesions result from increasing the sensitivity of the screening test or shortening the screening interval. Both liquid-based cytology and liquid-based cytology with HPV testing are cost effective (less than $50,000 per life-year saved) when performed at 3-year screening intervals. However, neither strategy is cost-effective when performed more frequently than every 3 years. CONCLUSION: Use of a more sensitive cervical cancer screening test increases costs. However, a more sensitive test performed less frequently may be more effective and less expensive than conventional cytology done annually. In the military setting, this has significant implications for both expense reduction and readiness enhancement.;Obstet Gynecol. 2002 Oct.100(4):740-8.;Maxwell GL1, Carlson JW, Ochoa M, Krivak T, Rose GS, Myers ER.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Care Costs*,Humans,Incidence,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Military Personnel*,Papillomaviridae*,Papillomavirus Infections/economics,Papillomavirus Infections/epidemiology*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Time Factors,Tumor Virus Infections/economics,Tumor Virus Infections/epidemiology*,United States/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Cost-effectiveness of using the Cervex-Brush (broom) compared to the elongated spatula for collection of conventional cervical cytology samples within a high-burden HIV setting: a model-based analysis.;Abstract BACKGROUND: From 2010 to 2014, approximately 2 million Pap smears from HIV-infected women were submitted to the South African National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS) through the national cervical cancer screening programme. The objective of this analysis was to determine whether using the plastic Cervex brush (broom) would be a cost-effective approach to improve cytology specimen quality as compared to the wooden spatula used currently. METHODS: A decision analysis model was built using the expected adequacy rates for samples collected with the spatula (<$0.02) and broom ($0.23) and the probability of detecting cervical dysplasia. NHLS data was used for testing volumes and rates of HIV-positivity, suitability of specimens, and presence of endocervical cells. Expected positivity of Pap smears in HIV-infected women (73 %), odds ratios of the effectiveness of the broom (OR: 1.57), and improved sensitivity when endocervical cells present (OR: 1.89) are from literature. NHLS costs were used for the collection devices and conventional cytology ($4.89). Cost of clinic visit is from WHO CHOICE ($8.36). RESULTS: In 2010, 80 % of specimens submitted to NHLS were adequate for evaluation. in 2014, only 54 % met the same criteria. For HIV-infected women, according to the guidelines model, using the wooden spatula costs $6.25 million per year, $16.79 per woman tested. Under intended practice, for each additional HSIL case detected among HIV-infected women, the South African cervical cancer screening programme could save $13.64 (95 % CI: $13.52 to $13.76) by using the broom as its standard of care collection device through increased collection of endocervical cells and consequent reduction in repeat Pap smears. CONCLUSION: Under a wide range of parameters tested using a simulation model, the more expensive plastic broom could save the South African cervical cancer screening programme money and increase detection of high-grade cervical dysplasia in HIV-infected women compared to the current wooden spatula.;BMC Health Serv Res. 2015 Nov 6.15:499. doi: 10.1186/s12913-015-1163-y.;Schnippel K1,2, Michelow P3,4, Chibwesha CJ5,6, Makura C7, Lince-Deroche N8, Goeieman B9, Mulongo M10, Jordaan S11,12, Firnhaber C13,14.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Cytisus,Female,HIV Infections*,Humans,Laboratories,Papanicolaou Test/instrumentation*,South Africa,Specimen Handling/instrumentation*,Surgical Instruments/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Vaginal Smears/instrumentation*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Cost-effectiveness of stereotactic large-core needle biopsy for nonpalpable breast lesions compared to open-breast biopsy.;Abstract This paper demonstrates that the introduction of large-core needle biopsy (LCNB) replacing needle-localised breast biopsy (NLBB) for nonpalpable (screen-detected) breast lesions could result in substantial cost savings at the expense of a possible slight increase in breast cancer mortality. The cost-effectiveness of LCNB and NLBB was estimated using a microsimulation model. The sensitivity of LCNB (0.97) and resource use and costs of LCNB and NLBB were derived from a multicentre consecutive cohort study among 973 women who consented in getting LCNB and NLBB, if LCNB was negative. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Replacing NLBB with LCNB would result in approximately six more breast cancer deaths per year (in a target population of 2.1 million women), or in 1000 extra life-years lost from breast cancer (effect over 100 years). The total costs of management of breast cancer (3% discounted) are estimated at pound 4676 million with NLBB. introducing LCNB would save pound 13 million. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of continued NLBB vs LCNB would be pound 12 482 per additional life-year gained (3% discounted). incremental costs range from pound -21 687 (low threshold for breast biopsy) to pound 74 378 (high sensitivity of LCNB).;Br J Cancer. 2004 Jan 26.90(2):383-92.;Groenewoud JH1, Pijnappel RM, van den Akker-Van Marle ME, Birnie E, Buijs-van der Woude T, Mali WP, de Koning HJ, Buskens E.;Multicenter Study,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Biopsy, Needle/economics,Biopsy, Needle/methods,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Cohort Studies,Cost Savings,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Stereotaxic Techniques/economics*,Survival Analysis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Cost-effectiveness of screening for colorectal cancer in France using a guaiac test versus an immunochemical test.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the cost and the effectiveness of two biennial fecal occult blood screening tests for colorectal cancer: a guaiac nonrehydrated test (G-FOBT) and an immunochemical test (I-FOBT) with the absence of screening. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare these strategies in a general population of subjects aged 50 to 74 over a 20-year period. RESULTS: Compared with the absence of screening, G-FOBT and I-FOBT were associated with a decrease in colorectal cancer mortality of 17.4 percent and 25.2 percent, respectively. With regard to cost-effectiveness, expressed as cost per life-year gained, I-FOBT was the most effective and most costly alternative. Compared with no screening, G-FOBT and I-FOBT presented similar discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: 2,739 euros and 2,819 euros respectively per life-year gained. When compared with G-FOBT, I-FOBT presented an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2,988 euros per life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses showed the strong influence of the I-FOBT lead time, of the participation rate to screening for I-FOBT, and of the purchase price of the I-FOBT on the discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the absence of screening and with G-FOBT, the biennial two-stool immunochemical test can be considered a promising method for mass screening for colorectal cancer.;Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2010 Jan.26(1):40-7. doi: 10.1017/S026646230999078X.;Lejeune C1, Dancourt V, Arveux P, Bonithon-Kopp C, Faivre J.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,France,Guaiac,Humans,Immunologic Tests,Indicators and Reagents,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Occult Blood,Sensitivity and Specificity,Indicators and Reagents,Guaiac;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Cost-effectiveness of increasing cervical cancer screening coverage in the Middle East: An example from Lebanon.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Most cervical cancer (CC) cases in Lebanon are detected at later stages and associated with high mortality. There is no national organized CC screening program so screening is opportunistic and limited to women who can pay out-of-pocket. Therefore, a small percentage of women receive repeated screenings while most are under-or never screened. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of increasing screening coverage and extending intervals. METHODS: We used an individual-based Monte Carlo model simulating HPV and CC natural history and screening. We calibrated the model to epidemiological data from Lebanon, including CC incidence and HPV type distribution. We evaluated cytology and HPV DNA screening for women aged 25-65years, varying coverage from 20 to 70% and frequency from 1 to 5years. RESULTS: At 20% coverage, annual cytologic screening reduced lifetime CC risk by 14% and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of I$80,670/year of life saved (YLS), far exceeding Lebanon's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (I$17,460), a commonly cited cost-effectiveness threshold. By comparison, increasing cytologic screening coverage to 50% and extending screening intervals to 3 and 5years provided greater CC reduction (26.1% and 21.4, respectively) at lower costs compared to 20% coverage with annual screening. Screening every 5years with HPV DNA testing at 50% coverage provided greater CC reductions than cytology at the same frequency (23.4%) and was cost-effective assuming a cost of I$18 per HPV test administered (I$12,210/YLS). HPV DNA testing every 4years at 50% coverage was also cost-effective at the same cost per test (I$16,340). Increasing coverage of annual cytology was not found to be cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Current practice of repeated cytology in a small percentage of women is inefficient. Increasing coverage to 50% with extended screening intervals provides greater health benefits at a reasonable cost and can more equitably distribute health gains. Novel HPV DNA strategies offer greater CC reductions and may be more cost-effective than cytology. Copyright � 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1;Cost-effectiveness of early detection of breast cancer in Catalonia (Spain).;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) causes more deaths than any other cancer among women in Catalonia. Early detection has contributed to the observed decline in BC mortality. However, there is debate on the optimal screening strategy. We performed an economic evaluation of 20 screening strategies taking into account the cost over time of screening and subsequent medical costs, including diagnostic confirmation, initial treatment, follow-up and advanced care. METHODS: We used a probabilistic model to estimate the effect and costs over time of each scenario. The effect was measured as years of life (YL), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and lives extended (LE). Costs of screening and treatment were obtained from the Early Detection Program and hospital databases of the IMAS-Hospital del Mar in Barcelona. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to compare the relative costs and outcomes of different scenarios. RESULTS: Strategies that start at ages 40 or 45 and end at 69 predominate when the effect is measured as YL or QALYs. Biennial strategies 50-69, 45-69 or annual 45-69, 40-69 and 40-74 were selected as cost-effective for both effect measures (YL or QALYs). The ICER increases considerably when moving from biennial to annual scenarios. Moving from no screening to biennial 50-69 years represented an ICER of 4,469€ per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: A reduced number of screening strategies have been selected for consideration by researchers, decision makers and policy planners. Mathematical models are useful to assess the impact and costs of BC screening in a specific geographical area.;BMC Cancer. 2011 May 23.11:192. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-192.;Carles M1, Vilaprinyo E, Cots F, Gregori A, Pla R, Román R, Sala M, Macià F, Castells X, Rue M.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy,Mammography,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Cost-effectiveness of digital mammography screening before the age of 50 in The Netherlands.;Abstract In the Netherlands, routine mammography screening starts at age 50. This starting age may have to be reconsidered because of the increasing breast cancer incidence among women aged 40 to 49 and the recent implementation of digital mammography. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of digital mammography screening that starts between age 40 and 49, using a microsimulation model. Women were screened before age 50, in addition to the current programme (biennial 50-74). Screening strategies varied in starting age (between 40 and 50) and frequency (annual or biennial). The numbers of breast cancers diagnosed, life-years gained (LYG) and breast cancer deaths averted were predicted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to compare screening scenarios. Biennial screening from age 50 to 74 (current strategy) was estimated to gain 157 life years per 1,000 women with lifelong follow-up, compared to a situation without screening, and cost €3,376/LYG (3.5% discounted). Additional screening increased the number of LYG, compared to no screening, ranging from 168 to 242. The costs to generate one additional LYG (i.e., ICER), comparing a screening strategy to the less intensive alternative, were estimated at €5,329 (biennial 48-74 vs. current strategy), €7,628 (biennial 45-74 vs. biennial 48-74), €10,826 (biennial 40-74 vs. biennial 45-74) and €18,759 (annual 40-49 + biennial 50-74 vs. biennial 40-74). Other strategies (49 + biennial 50-74 and annual 45-49 + biennial 50-74) resulted in less favourable ICERs. These findings show that extending the Dutch screening programme by screening between age 40 and 49 is cost-effective, particularly for biennial strategies.;Int J Cancer. 2015 Oct 15.137(8):1990-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29572.

1;Cost-Effectiveness of Different Cervical Screening Strategies in Islamic Republic of Iran: A Middle-Income Country with a Low Incidence Rate of Cervical Cancer.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide. Cervical screening programs have reduced the incidence and mortality rates of ICC. We studied the cost-effectiveness of different cervical screening strategies in the Islamic Republic of Iran, a Muslim country with a low incidence rate of ICC. METHODS: We constructed an 11-state Markov model, in which the parameters included regression and progression probabilities, test characteristics, costs, and utilities. these were extracted from primary data and the literature. Our strategies included Pap smear screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing plus Pap smear triaging with different starting ages and screening intervals. Model outcomes included lifetime costs, life years gained, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the stability of the results. RESULTS: We found that the prevented mortalities for the 11 strategies compared with no screening varied from 26% to 64%. The most cost-effective strategy was HPV screening, starting at age 35 years and repeated every 10 years. The ICER of this strategy was $8,875 per QALY compared with no screening. We found that screening at 5-year intervals was also cost-effective based on GDP per capita in Iran. CONCLUSION: We recommend organized cervical screening with HPV DNA testing for women in Iran, beginning at age 35 and repeated every 10 or 5 years. The results of this study could be generalized to other countries with low incidence rates of cervical cancer.;PLoS One. 2016 Jun 8.11(6):e0156705. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0156705. eCollection 2016.;Nahvijou A1, Daroudi R2, Tahmasebi M1, Amouzegar Hashemi F1, Rezaei Hemami M3, Akbari Sari A2, Barati Marenani A4, Zendehdel K5.;Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Costs and Cost Analysis,Female,Humans,Incidence,Iran/epidemiology,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic*,Papanicolaou Test/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms*/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms*/economics,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms*/mortality;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening in the average risk population.;Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in North America and in Israel. Risk of CRC increases exponentially with age starting at the age of 50 years. Therefore, people older than 50 years are being considered as an average risk population for CRC. The objective of this study was to obtain an improved assessment of the cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for CRC in the average risk population by using a more accurate technique, namely the Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis within the specific probability rates and costs in Israel. This study revealed that it is highly cost-effective to screen average-risk asymptomatic individuals.;Health Care Manag Sci. 2003 Aug.6(3):165-74.;Leshno M1, Halpern Z, Arber N.;Algorithms,Colonoscopy/economics,Colonoscopy/methods,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Humans,Israel/epidemiology,Life Expectancy,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Occult Blood,Risk Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening policies using simulation.;Abstract In this paper, we study breast cancer screening policies using computer simulation. We developed a multi-state Markov model for breast cancer progression, considering both the screening and treatment stages of breast cancer. The parameters of our model were estimated through data from the Canadian National Breast Cancer Screening Study as well as data in the relevant literature. Using computer simulation, we evaluated various screening policies to study the impact of mammography screening for age-based subpopulations in Canada. We also performed sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of certain parameters on number of deaths and total costs. The analysis comparing screening policies reveals that a policy in which women belonging to the 40-49 age group are not screened, whereas those belonging to the 50-59 and 60-69 age groups are screened once every 5 years, outperforms others with respect to cost per life saved. Our analysis also indicates that increasing the screening frequencies for the 50-59 and 60-69 age groups decrease mortality, and that the average number of deaths generally decreases with an increase in screening frequency. We found that screening annually for all age groups is associated with the highest costs per life saved. Our analysis thus reveals that cost per life saved increases with an increase in screening frequency.;Breast. 2015 Aug.24(4):440-8. doi: 10.1016/j.breast.2015.03.012.

1;Cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for integrating MRI into breast cancer screening for women at high risk.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for women at high risk for breast cancer. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of alternative screening strategies involving MRI. METHODS: Using a microsimulation model, we generated life histories under different risk profiles, and assessed the impact of screening on quality-adjusted life-years, and lifetime costs, both discounted at 3%. We compared 12 screening strategies combining annual or biennial MRI with mammography and clinical breast examination (CBE) in intervals of 0.5, 1, or 2 years vs without, and reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Based on an ICER threshold of $100,000/QALY, the most cost-effective strategy for women at 25% lifetime risk was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE every year from age 30 to 74, yielding ICER $58,400 (compared to biennial MRI alone). At 50% lifetime risk and with 70% reduction in MRI cost, the recommended strategy was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE every 6 months (ICER=$84,400). At 75% lifetime risk, the recommended strategy is biennial MRI combined with mammography plus CBE every 6 months (ICER=$62,800). CONCLUSIONS: The high costs of MRI and its lower specificity are limiting factors for annual screening schedule of MRI, except for women at sufficiently high risk.;Br J Cancer. 2014 Oct 14.111(8):1542-51. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2014.458.

1;Cost-effectiveness of a cervical screening program with human papillomavirus vaccine.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Recent introduction of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for girls in New Zealand is expected to decrease the incidence of HPV infection as well as resultant cytological abnormalities and cervical cancer. This may affect the cost-effectiveness of the national cervical screening program by reducing the incidence of lesions detected. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of the current cervical screening policy with and without the HPV vaccine and compares these results with the cost-effectiveness of a range of other screening strategies. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was built based on the natural history of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis. The model followed a hypothetical cohort of girls from 12 years to 85 years of age or death, through screening and treatment pathways. The model compared a no vaccine and current screening strategy with a selection of screening strategies with different age ranges and frequency intervals. RESULTS: The most cost-effective cervical screening strategy in the presence of the HPV vaccine would be screening women aged 30-60 every 5 years. Moving to this screening strategy from the base case of no vaccine and the current New Zealand strategy of screening women aged 20-69 every 3 years is predicted to have an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of NZ$9,841 (�4,428). CONCLUSIONS: Reducing screening intensity from 3 to 5 years as well as narrowing the screening age range for the vaccinated cohort once they reach mid-twenties is recommended. The importance of achieving a high vaccine uptake in New Zealand remains high.;Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2011 Oct.27(4):290-7. doi: 10.1017/S0266462311000456.

0;Cost-Effectiveness Models in Breast Cancer Screening in the General Population: A Systematic Review.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Many Western countries have long-established population-based mammography screening programs. Prior to implementing these programs, decision-analytic modeling was widely used to inform decisions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of cost-effectiveness models in breast cancer screening in the general population to analyze their structural and methodological approaches. METHODS: A systematic literature search for health economic models was performed in the electronic databases MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, CRD Databases, Cochrane Library, and EconLit in August 2011 with updates in June 2013, April 2015, and November 2016. To assess studies systematically, a standardized form was applied to extract relevant information that was then summarized in evidence tables. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies were included. 27 state-transition models were analyzed using cohort (n = 12) and individual-level simulation (n = 15). Twenty-one studies modeled the natural history of breast cancer and predicted mortality as a function of the early detection modality. The models employed different assumptions regarding ductal carcinoma in situ. Thirteen studies performed cost-utility analyses with different sources for utility values, but assumptions were often made about utility weights. Twenty-two models did not report any validation. CONCLUSION: State-transition modeling was the most frequently applied analytic approach. Different methods in modeling the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer were identified because there is currently no agreement on the biological behavior of noninvasive breast cancer. Main weaknesses were the lack of precise utility estimates and insufficient reporting of validation. Sensitivity analyses of assumptions regarding ductal carcinoma in situ and in particular adequate validation are critical to minimize the risk of biased model outcomes.;Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2017 Jun.15(3):333-351. doi: 10.1007/s40258-017-0312-3.;Schiller-Frühwirth IC1,2, Jahn B3,4, Arvandi M3, Siebert U3,4,5,6.;Review,Adult,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Cost-Benefit Analysis/statistics & numerical data*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Economic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Cost-effectiveness modeling of colorectal cancer: computed tomography colonography vs colonoscopy or fecal occult blood tests.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of three colorectal-cancer (CRC) screening strategies in France: fecal-occult-blood tests (FOBT), computed-tomography-colonography (CTC) and optical-colonoscopy (OC). METHODS: Ten-year simulation modeling was used to assess a virtual asymptomatic, average-risk population 50-74 years old. Negative OC was repeated 10 years later, and OC positive for advanced or non-advanced adenoma 3 or 5 years later, respectively. FOBT was repeated biennially. Negative CTC was repeated 5 years later. Positive CTC and FOBT led to triennial OC. Total cost and CRC rate after 10 years for each screening strategy and 0-100% adherence rates with 10% increments were computed. Transition probabilities were programmed using distribution ranges to account for uncertainty parameters. Direct medical costs were estimated using the French national health insurance prices. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses used 5000 Monte Carlo simulations generating model outcomes and standard deviations. RESULTS: For a given adherence rate, CTC screening was always the most effective but not the most cost-effective. FOBT was the least effective but most cost-effective strategy. OC was of intermediate efficacy and the least cost-effective strategy. Without screening, treatment of 123 CRC per 10,000 individuals would cost €3,444,000. For 60% adherence, the respective costs of preventing and treating, respectively 49 and 74 FOBT-detected, 73 and 50 CTC-detected and 63 and 60 OC-detected CRC would be €2,810,000, €6,450,000 and €9,340,000. CONCLUSION: Simulation modeling helped to identify what would be the most effective (CTC) and cost-effective screening (FOBT) strategy in the setting of mass CRC screening in France.

1;Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of a population-based screening program for colorectal cancer.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in Belgium. In Flanders (Belgium), a population-based screening program with a biennial immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) in women and men aged 56-74 has been organised since 2013. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the colorectal population-based screening program in Flanders (Belgium). METHODS: A health economic model was conducted, consisting of a decision tree simulating the screening process and a Markov model, with a time horizon of 20years, simulating natural progression. Predicted mortality and incidence, total costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with and without the screening program were calculated in order to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CRC screening. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted, taking into account uncertainty of the model parameters. RESULTS: Mortality and incidence were predicted to decrease over 20years. The colorectal screening program in Flanders is found to be cost-effective with an ICER of 1681/QALY (95% CI -1317 to 6601) in males and €4,484/QALY (95% CI -3254 to 18,163). The probability of being cost-effective given a threshold of €35,000/QALY was 100% and 97.3%, respectively. The budget impact analysis showed the extra cost for the health care payer to be limited. CONCLUSION: This health economic analysis has shown that despite the possible adverse effects of screening and the extra costs for the health care payer and the patient, the population-based screening program for CRC in Flanders is cost-effective and should therefore be maintained.

0;Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for lung cancer with low dose spiral CT (computed tomography) in the Australian setting.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: Low dose spiral computed tomography (CT) is a sensitive screening tool for lung cancer that is currently being evaluated in both non-randomised studies and randomised controlled trials. METHODS: We conducted a quantitative decision analysis using a Markov model to determine whether, in the Australian setting, offering spiral CT screening for lung cancer to high risk individuals would be cost-effective compared with current practice. This exploratory analysis was undertaken predominantly from the perspective of the government as third-party funder. In the base-case analysis, the costs and health outcomes (life-years saved and quality-adjusted life years) were calculated in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 male current smokers for two alternatives: (1) screen for lung cancer with annual CT for 5 years starting at age 60 year and treat those diagnosed with cancer or (2) no screening and treat only those who present with symptomatic cancer. RESULTS: For male smokers aged 60-64 years, with an annual incidence of lung cancer of 552 per 100,000, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 57,325 dollars per life-year saved and 105,090 dollars per QALY saved. For females aged 60-64 years with the same annual incidence of lung cancer, the cost-effectiveness ratio was 51,001 dollars per life-year saved and 88,583 dollars per QALY saved. The model was used to examine the relationship between efficacy in terms of the expected reduction in lung cancer mortality at 7 years and cost-effectiveness. In the base-case analysis lung cancer mortality was reduced by 27% and all cause mortality by 2.1%. Changes in the estimated proportion of stage I cancers detected by screening had the greatest impact on the efficacy of the intervention and the cost-effectiveness. The results were also sensitive to assumptions about the test performance characteristics of CT scanning, the proportion of lung cancer cases overdiagnosed by screening, intervention rates for benign disease, the discount rate, the cost of CT, the quality of life in individuals with early stage screen-detected cancer and disutility associated with false positive diagnoses. Given current knowledge and practice, even under favourable assumptions, reductions in lung cancer mortality of less than 20% are unlikely to be cost-effective, using a value of 50,000 dollars per life-year saved as the threshold to define a cost-effective intervention. CONCLUSION: The most feasible scenario under which CT screening for lung cancer could be cost-effective would be if very high-risk individuals are targeted and screening is either highly effective or CT screening costs fall substantially.;Lung Cancer. 2005 May.48(2):171-85.

1;Cost-effectiveness analysis of fecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Clinical trials have demonstrated that fecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer can significantly reduce mortality. However, to be deemed a priority from a public health policy perspective, any new program must prove itself to be cost-effective. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening for colorectal cancer using a fecal occult blood screening test, the Hemoccult-II, in a cohort of 100,000 asymptomatic individuals 50-74 years of age. METHODS: A decision analysis model using a Markov approach simulates the trajectory of the cohort allocated either to screening or no screening over a 20-year period through several health states. Clinical and economic data used in the model came from the Burgundy trial, French population-based studies, and Registry data. RESULTS: Modeling biennial screening versus the absence of screening over a 20-year period resulted in a 17.7 percent mortality reduction and a discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 3357 Euro per life-year gained among individuals 50-74 years of age. Sensitivity analyses performed on epidemiological and economic data showed the strong impact on the results of colonoscopy cost, of compliance to screening, and of specificity of the screening test. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness estimates and sensitivity analyses suggest that biennial screening for colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood test could be recommended from the age of 50 until 74. Our findings support the attempts to introduce large-scale population screening programs.;Int J Technol Assess Health Care. 2004 Fall.20(4):434-9.;Lejeune C1, Arveux P, Dancourt V, Béjean S, Bonithon-Kopp C, Faivre J.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Occult Blood*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Cost-effectiveness analysis of colorectal cancer screening strategies in Singapore: a dynamic decision analytic approach.;Abstract A dynamic decision analytic framework using local statistics and expert's opinions is put to study the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening strategies in Singapore. It is demonstrated that any of the screening strategies, if implemented, would increase the life expectancy of the population of 50 to 70 years old. The model also determined the normal life expectancy of this population to be 76.32 years. Overall, Guaiac Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) is most cost effective at SGD162.11 per life year saved per person. Our approach allowed us to model problem parameters that change over time and study the utility measures like cost and life expectancy for specific age within the range of 50- 69 through to 70 years old.;Stud Health Technol Inform. 2004.107(Pt 1):104-10.;Wong SS1, Leong AP, Leong TY.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Barium Sulfate,Colonoscopy/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Decision Support Techniques*,Enema/economics,Female,Humans,Life Expectancy,Male,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Occult Blood,Sigmoidoscopy/economics,Singapore,Barium Sulfate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Cost-effectiveness analysis of cervical cancer screening strategies based on the Papanicolaou smear test in Korea.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing number of screening examinations performed for cervical cancer utilizing the Papanicolaou smear test (Pap test), few studies have examined whether this strategy is cost-effective in Korea. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening strategies incorporating the Pap test based on age at the start and end of screening as well as screening interval. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed four alternative screening strategies based on patient age when screening was started (20 or 30 years) and discontinued (lifetime, 79 years). Each strategy was assessed at screening intervals of 1, 2, 3, or 5 years. A Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the 16 possible cervical cancer screening strategies, and this was evaluated from a societal perspective. The main outcome measures were average lifetime cost, incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Compared with various strategies comprising younger starting age, discontinuation age, and longer screening intervals, strategies employing annual screening for cervical cancer starting at a target age of 30 years and above were the most cost-effective, with an ICER of 21,012.98 dollars per QALY gained (with a Korean threshold of 30,000,000 KRW or US$27,272). CONCLUSIONS: We found that annual screening for cervical cancer beginning at a target age of 30 years and above is most cost-effective screening strategy. Considering the potential economic advantages, more intense screening policies for cervical cancer might be favorable among countries with high rates of cervical cancer and relatively low screening costs.;Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2015.16(6):2317-22.;Ko MJ1, Kim J, Kim Y, Lee YJ, Hong SR, Lee JK.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Aged,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/economics*,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Neoplasm Grading,Neoplasm Staging,Papanicolaou Test/economics*,Papillomaviridae/isolation & purification,Papillomavirus Infections/diagnosis,Papillomavirus Infections/economics*,Papillomavirus Infections/virology,Prognosis,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Republic of Korea,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Young Adult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Cost-effectiveness analysis of anal cancer screening in women with cervical neoplasia in British Columbia, Canada.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Precursors to anal squamous cell carcinoma may be detectable through screening. however, the literature suggests that population-level testing is not cost-effective. Given that high-grade cervical neoplasia (CIN) is associated with an increased risk of developing anal cancer, and in light of changing guidelines for the follow-up and management of cervical neoplasia, it is worthwhile to examine the costs and effectiveness of an anal cancer screening program delivered to women with previously-detected CIN. METHODS: A model of anal cancer screening and treatment was constructed, to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a population of CIN II/III+ women who were screened using anal cytology vs. one that received no anal cancer screening. Costs were based on Canadian estimates, and survival was based on estimates taken from the scientific literature. Effectiveness was measured in terms of life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The model was run for 50 cycles, with each cycle representing one year. RESULTS: Incremental cost (screened vs. unscreened) was $82.17 per woman in the model. Incremental effectiveness was 0.004 LYG, and was equivalent to zero in terms of QALY. An ICER of $20,561/LYG was calculated, while no meaningful incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) could be calculated for quality-adjusted survival. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that anal cancer screening is cost-effective in terms of overall survival in women with a previous diagnosis of CIN II or CIN III as part of regular follow-up, but may not contribute meaningfully-different quality-adjusted survival due to the adverse effects of screening-related interventions.;BMC Health Serv Res. 2016 Jun 27.16:206. doi: 10.1186/s12913-016-1442-2.;Cromwell I1,2, Gaudet M3,4, Peacock SJ5,6,7, Aquino-Parsons C3.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Anus Neoplasms/diagnosis*,British Columbia,Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis*,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics*,Female,Health Care Costs,Humans,Models, Statistical,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/complications*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Cost-effectiveness analyses in gynecologic oncology: methodological quality and trends.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To evaluate methodological quality and trends of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) published in gynecologic oncology. METHODS: A medical literature search of articles from 1966 through 2002 was performed to identify original, English-language articles that included economic analyses in gynecologic oncology. We included articles that were cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analyses or performed these analyses as part of their study. Ten methodological principles that should be incorporated in CEAs were assessed for each study. Each article was given a score of 0, 1, or 2 for each of the 10 methodological principles (max score = 20). Data were analyzed using the Student t test, ANOVA, and linear regression. RESULTS: We screened 693 articles to identify 68 that met our inclusion criteria. The articles focused on cervical cancer (n = 53. 78%), ovarian cancer (n = 11. 16%), uterine cancer (n = 2. 3%), and general perioperative care (n = 2. 3%). The mean (+/-SD) methodological principle score was 16.1 (+/-4.1) and we observed a significant improvement in the total score over time (P = 0.01). Primary CEA's (CEA identified as the objective of the study) were of higher quality than secondary CEA's (primary objective of the study was not CEA but CEA was included in the study. total scores 18.2 vs. 11.6, respectively. P<0.0001). Studies with at least one investigator in public health or healthcare economies also had higher quality (mean total score 17.7 vs. 15.2. P=0.006). The most common limitations of published CEAs were in methodology or presentation of incremental analyses, sensitivity analyses, and discounting. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analyses in gynecologic oncology showed significant improvement in quality over the last two decades. Despite this progress, methodological improvement is still needed in the areas of incremental comparisons and sensitivity analysis. Understanding the methodology of cost-effectiveness analysis is critical for researchers, editors, and readers to accurately interpret results of the growing body of CEA articles.;Gynecol Oncol. 2004 Apr.93(1):1-8.;Manuel MR1, Chen LM, Caughey AB, Subak LL.;Meta-Analysis,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Analysis of Variance,Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods,Cost-Benefit Analysis/standards*,Cost-Benefit Analysis/trends,Female,Gynecology/economics*,Humans,Linear Models,Medical Oncology/economics*,K12 HD01262-02/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Cost-benefit analysis and mammographic screening: a travel cost approach.;Abstract This study describes the methodology and presents preliminary results of an economic appraisal of a program to use mobile mammographic screening units in rural areas of Australia. The benefits of the project are measured using the travel cost method. Since mammograms are a 'binary good', conventional welfare analysis must be modified and discrete choice models used to estimate the demand for screening. The results suggest that the level of welfare benefits depends on the distance a town is from the nearest fixed screening unit. In the 10 towns studied, the economic benefits of mobile screening outweighed the economic costs if a rural town is situated 29 km or more from a fixed mammographic screening unit.;J Health Econ. 1998 Dec.17(6):767-87.;Clarke PM1.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Catchment Area (Health),Choice Behavior,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Services Accessibility/economics*,Humans,Mammography/economics*,Mammography/utilization,Middle Aged,Mobile Health Units/economics*,Mobile Health Units/utilization,Models, Statistical,New South Wales,Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology*,Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data,Program Evaluation,Rural Health Services/economics*,Rural Health Services/utilization,Travel/economics*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Cost of breast-related care in the year following false positive screening mammograms.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate the direct cost, from the perspective of the health insurer or purchaser, of breast-care services in the year following a false positive screening mammogram compared with a true negative examination. DESIGN: We identified 21,125 women aged 40 to 80 years enrolled in an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, who participated in screening mammography between January 1, 1998 and July 30, 2002. Pathology and cancer registry data were used to identify breast cancer diagnoses in the year following the screening mammogram. A positive examination was defined as a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment of 0, 4, or 5. Women with a positive screening mammogram but no breast cancer diagnosed within 1 year were classified as false positives. We used diagnostic and procedure codes in automated health plan data to identify services received in the year following the screening mammogram. Medicare reimbursement rates were applied to all services. We used ordinary least-squares linear regression to estimate the difference in costs following a false positive versus true negative screening mammogram. RESULTS: False positive results occurred in 9.9% of women. most false positives (87.3%) were followed by breast imaging only. The mean cost of breast-care following a false positive mammogram was $527. This was $503 (95% confidence interval, $490-$515) more than the cost of breast-care services for true negative women. CONCLUSIONS: The direct costs for breast-related procedures following false positive screening mammograms may contribute substantially to US healthcare spending.;Med Care. 2010 Sep.48(9):815-20. doi: 10.1097/MLR.0b013e3181e57918.;Chubak J1, Boudreau DM, Fishman PA, Elmore JG.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,False Positive Reactions,Female,Health Care Costs/statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Linear Models,Mammography/economics*,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Registries,Washington,R01 CA107623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA063731/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA106790/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA120562-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,K05 CA104699/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA120562/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Cost effectiveness of mammography screening for Chinese women.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Although the cost effectiveness of screening mammography in most western developed populations has been accepted, it may not apply to Chinese women, who have a much lower breast cancer incidence. The authors estimated the cost effectiveness of biennial mammography in Hong Kong Chinese women to inform evidence-based screening policies. METHODS: For the current study, a state-transition Markov model was developed to simulate mammography screening, breast cancer diagnosis, and treatment in a hypothetical cohort of Chinese women. The benefit of mammography was modeled by assuming a stage shift, in which cancers in screened women were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier disease stage. The authors compared costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, and life years saved (LYS) for 5 screening strategies. RESULTS: Biennial screening resulted in a gain in life expectancy ranging from 4.3 days to 9.4 days compared with no screening at an incremental cost of from US $1,166 to US $2,425 per woman. The least costly, nondominated screening option was screening from ages 40 years to 69 years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US $61,600 per QALY saved or US $64,400 per LYS compared with no screening. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probability of the ICER being below a threshold of US $50,000 per QALY (LYS) was 15.3% (14.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that mammography for Hong Kong Chinese women currently may not be cost effective based on the arbitrary threshold of US $50,000 per QALY. However, clinicians must remain vigilant and periodically should revisit the question of population screening: Disease rates in China have been increasing because of westernization and socioeconomic development.;Cancer. 2007 Aug 15.110(4):885-95.;Wong IO1, Kuntz KM, Cowling BJ, Lam CL, Leung GM.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Asian Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Hong Kong/epidemiology,Humans,Incidence,Mammography/economics*,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Correlation of tumor size and survival in patients with stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between tumor size and survival in patients with stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer. ie, lesions < 3 cm). METHOD: Five hundred ten patients with pathologic stage IA (T1N0M0) non-small cell lung cancer were identified from our tumor registry over an 18-year period (from 1981 to 1999). There were 285 men and 225 women, with a mean age of 63 years (range, 31 to 90 years). The Cox proportional model was used to examine the effect on survival. Tumor size was incorporated into the model as a linear effect and as categorical variables. The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator was used to graphically display the relationship between the tumor size and survival. RESULTS: The Cox proportional hazards model did not show a statistically significant relationship between tumor size and survival (p = 0.701) as a linear effect. Tumor size was then categorized into quartiles, and again there was no statistically significant difference in survival between groups (p = 0.597). Tumor size was also categorized into deciles, and there was no statistical relationship between tumor size and survival (p = 0.674). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms stratifying patients with stage IA non-small cell lung cancer in the same TNM classification, given no apparent difference in survival. Unfortunately, these data caution that improved small nodule detection with screening CT may not significantly improve lung cancer mortality.

0;Correlating chemical sensitivity and basal gene expression reveals mechanism of action.;Abstract Changes in cellular gene expression in response to small-molecule or genetic perturbations have yielded signatures that can connect unknown mechanisms of action (MoA) to ones previously established. We hypothesized that differential basal gene expression could be correlated with patterns of small-molecule sensitivity across many cell lines to illuminate the actions of compounds whose MoA are unknown. To test this idea, we correlated the sensitivity patterns of 481 compounds with ∼19,000 basal transcript levels across 823 different human cancer cell lines and identified selective outlier transcripts. This process yielded many novel mechanistic insights, including the identification of activation mechanisms, cellular transporters and direct protein targets. We found that ML239, originally identified in a phenotypic screen for selective cytotoxicity in breast cancer stem-like cells, most likely acts through activation of fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2).

0;Correcting for lead time and length bias in estimating the effect of screen detection on cancer survival.;Abstract Determination of survival time among persons with screen-detected cancer is subject to lead time and length biases. The authors propose a simple correction for lead time, assuming an exponential distribution of the preclinical screen-detectable period. Assuming two latent categories of tumors, one of which is more prone to screen detection and correspondingly less prone to death from the cancer in question, the authors have developed a strategy of sensitivity analysis for various magnitudes of length bias. Here they demonstrate these methods using a series of 25,962 breast cancer cases (1988-2004) from the West Midlands, United Kingdom.;Am J Epidemiol. 2008 Jul 1.168(1):98-104. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwn120.

0;Correcting for bias in the selection and validation of informative diagnostic tests.;Abstract When developing a new diagnostic test for a disease, there are often multiple candidate classifiers to choose from, and it is unclear if any will offer an improvement in performance compared with current technology. A two-stage design can be used to select a promising classifier (if one exists) in stage one for definitive validation in stage two. However, estimating the true properties of the chosen classifier is complicated by the first stage selection rules. In particular, the usual maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) that combines data from both stages will be biased high. Consequently, confidence intervals and p-values flowing from the MLE will also be incorrect. Building on the results of Pepe et al. (SIM 28:762-779), we derive the most efficient conditionally unbiased estimator and exact confidence intervals for a classifier's sensitivity in a two-stage design with arbitrary selection rules. the condition being that the trial proceeds to the validation stage. We apply our estimation strategy to data from a recent family history screening tool validation study by Walter et al. (BJGP 63:393-400) and are able to identify and successfully adjust for bias in the tool's estimated sensitivity to detect those at higher risk of breast cancer.;Stat Med. 2015 Apr 15.34(8):1417-37. doi: 10.1002/sim.6413.

0;COPD is commonly underdiagnosed in patients with lung cancer: results from the RECOIL study (retrospective study of COPD infradiagnosis in lung cancer).;Abstract INTRODUCTION: Many patients with COPD are underdiagnosed, including patients with coexisting lung cancer. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of COPD prevalence and outcomes among all patients diagnosed with lung cancer at our institution during a 2-year period. Patients with known COPD (group A) were compared with those who received a diagnosis of COPD at the time of their oncologic workup (group B). RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer during the study period, including 87 with COPD (28.6%). Sixty percent of patients with coexisting lung cancer and COPD were unaware of their obstructive airways disease prior to the lung cancer diagnosis. Patients in group A were older (74+9 vs 69+9 years. P=0.03), had more severe obstruction (% of predicted forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1%] 55+17 vs 71+13. P=0.04), more emphysema (91% vs 65%. P=0.02), and worse diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide 59+19% vs 72+22%. P=0.01) than patients in group B, but the latter had more advanced lung cancer (27.3% vs 13.8% stage IV disease. P=0.01) and consumed more outpatient resources (P=0.03). Overall mortality was similar (56% vs 58%). However, stage-adjusted mortality showed a trend toward greater mortality in group B patients (1.87 [0.91-3.85]. P=0.087). CONCLUSION: COPD infradiagnosis is common in patients with coexisting lung cancer and is associated with more advanced cancer stage, greater outpatient resource consumption, and may be associated with greater stage-adjusted mortality.;Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis. 2017 Mar 30.12:1033-1038. doi: 10.2147/COPD.S123426. eCollection 2017.;Parrón Collar D1, Pazos Guerra M1, Rodriguez P1,2, Gotera C1,2, Mahíllo-Fernández I2, Peces-Barba G1,2, Seijo LM1,2.;Observational Study,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Comorbidity,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Health Resources/utilization,Humans,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Lung/pathology,Lung/physiopathology*,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Lung Neoplasms/mortality,Lung Neoplasms/physiopathology,Male,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Predictive Value of Tests,Prevalence,Proportional Hazards Models,Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/diagnosis*,Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/epidemiology*,Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/mortality,Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/physiopathology,Respiratory Function Tests,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,Spain/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Computerized breast cancer analysis system using three stage semi-supervised learning method.;Abstract BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A large number of labeled medical image data is usually a requirement to train a well-performed computer-aided detection (CAD) system. But the process of data labeling is time consuming, and potential ethical and logistical problems may also present complications. As a result, incorporating unlabeled data into CAD system can be a feasible way to combat these obstacles. METHODS: In this study we developed a three stage semi-supervised learning (SSL) scheme that combines a small amount of labeled data and larger amount of unlabeled data. The scheme was modified on our existing CAD system using the following three stages: data weighing, feature selection, and newly proposed dividing co-training data labeling algorithm. Global density asymmetry features were incorporated to the feature pool to reduce the false positive rate. Area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy were computed using 10 fold cross validation method to evaluate the performance of our CAD system. The image dataset includes mammograms from 400 women who underwent routine screening examinations, and each pair contains either two cranio-caudal (CC) or two mediolateral-oblique (MLO) view mammograms from the right and the left breasts. From these mammograms 512 regions were extracted and used in this study, and among them 90 regions were treated as labeled while the rest were treated as unlabeled. RESULTS: Using our proposed scheme, the highest AUC observed in our research was 0.841, which included the 90 labeled data and all the unlabeled data. It was 7.4% higher than using labeled data only. With the increasing amount of labeled data, AUC difference between using mixed data and using labeled data only reached its peak when the amount of labeled data was around 60. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that our proposed three stage semi-supervised learning can improve the CAD performance by incorporating unlabeled data. Using unlabeled data is promising in computerized cancer research and may have a significant impact for future CAD system applications. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

0;Computer-assisted cervical cancer screening using neural networks.;Abstract A practical and effective system for the computer-assisted screening of conventionally prepared cervical smears is presented and described. Recent developments in neural network technology have made computerized analysis of the complex cellular scenes found on Pap smears possible. The PAPNET Cytological Screening System uses neural networks to automatically analyze conventional smears by locating and recognizing potentially abnormal cells. It then displays images of these objects for review and final diagnosis by qualified cytologists. The results of the studies presented indicate that the PAPNET system could be a useful tool for both the screening and rescreening of cervical smears. In addition, the system has been shown to be sensitive to some types of abnormalities which have gone undetected during manual screening.;Cancer Lett. 1994 Mar 15.77(2-3):155-62.;Mango LJ1.;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted*,Female,Humans,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Papanicolaou Test*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Vaginal Smears*;;;;;;;;;;;;;model valid;0.254
0;Computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer based on fine needle biopsy microscopic images.;Abstract Prompt and widely available diagnostics of breast cancer is crucial for the prognosis of patients. One of the diagnostic methods is the analysis of cytological material from the breast. This examination requires extensive knowledge and experience of the cytologist. Computer-aided diagnosis can speed up the diagnostic process and allow for large-scale screening. One of the largest challenges in the automatic analysis of cytological images is the segmentation of nuclei. In this study, four different clustering algorithms are tested and compared in the task of fast nuclei segmentation. K-means, fuzzy C-means, competitive learning neural networks and Gaussian mixture models were incorporated for clustering in the color space along with adaptive thresholding in grayscale. These methods were applied in a medical decision support system for breast cancer diagnosis, where the cases were classified as either benign or malignant. In the segmented nuclei, 42 morphological, topological and texture features were extracted. Then, these features were used in a classification procedure with three different classifiers. The system was tested for classification accuracy by means of microscopic images of fine needle breast biopsies. In cooperation with the Regional Hospital in Zielona Góra, 500 real case medical images from 50 patients were collected. The acquired classification accuracy was approximately 96-100%, which is very promising and shows that the presented method ensures accurate and objective data acquisition that could be used to facilitate breast cancer diagnosis.;Comput Biol Med. 2013 Oct.43(10):1563-72. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2013.08.003.

0;Computer assisted diagnosis of fine needle aspirate of the breast.;Abstract The development of the National Breast Screening Programme has created a demand for the widespread availability of fine needle aspiration cytology services. To meet this demand there must be a rapid increase in the number of pathologists and laboratories able to offer this service. In turn there is a need for improved training methods. The technique of fine needle aspiration cytology is not inherently complicated. The number of possible conclusions is essentially limited to four: unsatisfactory, benign, suspicious and malignant. A computer based expert system, designed to assist pathologists in the diagnosis of fine needle aspirates of the breast, has been developed. The system prompts pathologists to categorize a number of variables in the aspirate including nuclear and cytoplasmic features, and the degree of cellular cohesion, and uses these data to reason about possible conclusions. The final diagnosis is displayed with a detailed explanation listing the factors supporting it. Initial trials with this system have been encouraging and it is envisaged that this system will be of value both in training and as an aid to routine diagnosis.;J Clin Pathol. 1990 Feb.43(2):168-70.;Heathfield HA1, Kirkham N, Ellis IO, Winstanley G.;Biopsy, Needle,Breast/pathology,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted*,Expert Systems,Female,Humans;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Computational screening, ensemble docking and pharmacophore analysis of potential gefitinib analogues against epidermal growth factor receptor.;Abstract The observable mutated isoforms of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are important considerable therapeutic benchmarks in moderating the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recently, quinazoline-based ATP competitive inhibitors have been developed against the EGFR. however, these imply the mutation probabilities, which contribute to the discovery of high probable novel inhibitors for EGFR mutants. Therefore, SAR-based bioactivity analysis, molecular docking and computational toxicogenomics approaches were performed to identify and evaluate new analogs of gefitinib against the ligand-binding domain of the EGFR double-mutated model. From the diverse groups of molecular clustering and molecular screening strategies, top high-binding gefitinib-analogues were identified and studied against EGFR core cavity through three-phase ensemble docking approach. Resulted high possible leads showed good binding orientations than gefitinib (positive control) thus they were subjected to pharmacophore analysis that possesses possible molecular assets to tight binding with EGFR domain. Residues Ser720, Arg841 and Trp880 were observed as novel hot spots and involved in H-bonds, pi-stacking and π-cation interactions that contribute additional electrostatic potency to sustain stability and complexity of protein-ligand complexes, thus they have ability to profoundly adopted by pharmacophoric features. Furthermore, lead molecules have an inhibition percent probability, anticancer potency, toxic impacts, flexible pharmacokinetics, potential gene-chemical interactions towards EGFR were revealed by computational systems biology tools. Our multiple screening strategies confirmed that the druggable sub-pocket was crucial to strong EGFR-ligand binding. The essential pharmacophoric features of ligands provided viewpoints for new inhibitors envisaging, and predicted scaffolds could used as anticancer agents against selected EGFR mutated isoforms.;J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2018 Feb.38(1):48-60. doi: 10.1080/10799893.2018.1426603.;Bommu UD1, Konidala KK1, Pamanji R2, Yeguvapalli S1.;Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry*,Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use,Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy*,Humans,Ligands,Molecular Docking Simulation,Mutation,Protein Binding,Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry,Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use,Quinazolines/chemistry*,Quinazolines/therapeutic use,Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors*,Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor/chemistry,Antineoplastic Agents,Ligands,Protein Kinase Inhibitors,Quinazolines,EGFR protein, human,Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor,gefitinib;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Computational Discrimination of Breast Cancer for Korean Women Based on Epidemiologic Data Only.;Abstract Breast cancer is the second leading cancer for Korean women and its incidence rate has been increasing annually. If early diagnosis were implemented with epidemiologic data, the women could easily assess breast cancer risk using internet. National Cancer Institute in the United States has released a Web-based Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool based on Gail model. However, it is inapplicable directly to Korean women since breast cancer risk is dependent on race. Also, it shows low accuracy (58%-59%). In this study, breast cancer discrimination models for Korean women are developed using only epidemiological case-control data (n = 4,574). The models are configured by different classification techniques: support vector machine, artificial neural network, and Bayesian network. A 1,000-time repeated random sub-sampling validation is performed for diverse parameter conditions, respectively. The performance is evaluated and compared as an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). According to age group and classification techniques, AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and calculation time of all models were calculated and compared. Although the support vector machine took the longest calculation time, the highest classification performance has been achieved in the case of women older than 50 yr (AUC = 64%). The proposed model is dependent on demographic characteristics, reproductive factors, and lifestyle habits without using any clinical or genetic test. It is expected that the model could be implemented as a web-based discrimination tool for breast cancer. This tool can encourage potential breast cancer prone women to go the hospital for diagnostic tests.;J Korean Med Sci. 2015 Aug.30(8):1025-34. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2015.30.8.1025.

0;Competing risks to breast cancer mortality.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Simulation models analyzing the impact of treatment interventions and screening on the level of breast cancer mortality require an input of mortality from causes other than breast cancer, or competing risks. METHODS: This chapter presents an actuarial method of creating cohort life tables using published data that removes breast cancer as a cause of death. RESULTS: Mortality from causes other than breast cancer as a percentage of all-cause mortality is smallest for women in their forties and fifties, as small as 85% of the all-cause rate, although the level and percentage of the impact varies by birth cohort. CONCLUSION: This method produces life tables by birth cohort and by age that are easily included as a common input by the various CISNET modeling groups to predict mortality from other causes. Attention to removing breast cancer mortality from all-cause mortality is worthwhile, because breast cancer mortality can be as high as 15% at some ages.;J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2006.(36):15-9.;Rosenberg MA1.;Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Cohort Studies,Computer Simulation*,Databases, Factual,Female,Humans,Life Tables*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Predictive Value of Tests,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Survival Rate,United States/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Colorectal cancer screening in Australia: an economic evaluation of a potential biennial screening program using faecal occult blood tests.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the introduction of a national, co-ordinated screening program using the faecal occult blood test represents 'value-for-money' from the perspective of the Australian Government as third-party funder. METHODS: The annual equivalent costs and consequences of a biennial screening program in 'steady-state' operation were estimated for the Australian population using 1996 as the reference year. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the years of life lost (YLLs) averted, and the health service costs were modelled, based on the epidemiology and the costs of colorectal cancer in Australia together with the mortality reduction achieved in randomised controlled trials. Uncertainty in the model was examined using Monte Carlo simulation methods. RESULTS: We estimate a minimum or 'base program' of screening those aged 55 to 69 years could avert 250 deaths per annum (95% uncertainty interval 99-400), at a gross cost of dollarsA55 million (95% UI dollarsA46 million to dollarsA96 million) and a gross incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dollarsA17,000/DALY (95% UI dollarsA13,000/DALY to dollarsA52,000/DALY). Extending the program to include 70 to 74-year-olds is a more effective option (cheaper and higher health gain) than including the 50 to 54-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study support the case for a national program directed at the 55 to 69-year-old age group with extension to 70 to 74-year-olds if there are sufficient resources. The pilot tests recently announced in Australia provide an important opportunity to consider the age range for screening and the sources of uncertainty, identified in the modelled evaluation, to assist decisions on implementing a full national program.;Aust N Z J Public Health. 2004 Jun.28(3):273-82.;Stone CA1, Carter RC, Vos T, John JS.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Australia/epidemiology,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Humans,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/standards*,Mass Screening/utilization,Occult Blood*,Sensitivity and Specificity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Colonoscopic surveillance of first-degree relatives of colorectal cancer patients in a faecal occult blood screening programme.;Abstract BACKGROUND: In some Italian areas, colonoscopic surveillance of first-degree relatives (FDRs) of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is provided as a part of local population-based faecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening programmes. The objective of the present study was to assess the feasibility and early results of this surveillance model. METHODS: Data from district screening centres were used to evaluate the process of identification and selection of eligible FDRs (residence in the Emilia-Romagna Region, age 40-75 years, no recent colonoscopy) of screen-detected CRC patients and the detected prevalence of disease. The probability for an FDR to undergo colonoscopy and to be diagnosed with CRC and advanced adenoma was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The sex- and age-standardised ratio of detected prevalence to that expected based on results from a colonoscopy screening study of the Italian general population was estimated. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2011, 9319 FDRs of 2437 screen-detected CRC patients (3.8 per patient) were identified and contacted. Their likelihood of being eligible for, and accepting, colonoscopy was 0.11 (95% confidence interval: 0.11-0.12). Among the 926 subjects undergoing colonoscopy, the prevalence of previous negative screening FOBT was 63%. Eleven CRCs (1.2%) and 100 advanced adenomas (10.8%) were detected. The standardised ratio of detected prevalence to that expected was 0.91 (95% confidence interval: 0.19-2.66) for CRC and 1.48 (1.04-2.05) for advanced adenoma. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure of selection of FDRs was extremely ineffective. Due to previous negative screening tests, the prevalence of disease was less than expected. A population-based FOBT screening programme is a highly unsuitable setting for the provision of surveillance to FDRs of CRC patients. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

0;Cognitive impairment: an independent predictor of excess mortality: a cohort study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Dementia is a leading cause of death among older adults, but less is known about the mortality risk associated with milder forms of cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cognitive impairment is independently associated with increased long-term mortality in primary care patients aged 60 years and older. DESIGN: Linkage of electronic health records from a cohort recruited between January 1991 and May 1993 with data from the National Death Index through 31 December 2006. SETTING: A public safety-net hospital and its community health centers. PATIENTS: 3957 older adults aged 60 to 102 years who were screened at scheduled primary care appointments. MEASUREMENTS: At baseline, patients were screened for cognitive impairment by using the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire and were categorized into groups with no, mild, or moderate to severe cognitive impairment. Baseline data from comprehensive electronic health records were linked with vital status obtained from the National Death Index. Kaplan-Meier survival curves compared time to death for the groups with cognitive impairment. Cox proportional hazards models controlled for mortality risk factors. RESULTS: At baseline, 3157 patients had no cognitive impairment, 533 had mild impairment, and 267 had moderate to severe impairment. Overall, 2385 of the 3957 patients (60.3%) died during the observation period: 1812 (57.4%) patients with no cognitive impairment, 363 (68.1%) patients with mild impairment, and 210 (78.7%) patients with moderate to severe impairment. Both mild and moderate to severe cognitive impairment were associated with increased mortality hazard independent of other mortality risk factors (hazard ratio, 1.184 [95% CI, 1.051 to 1.334] and for mild impairment 1.447 [CI, 1.235 to 1.695] for moderate to severe impairment). Median survival for all 3957 participants was 129 months. Median survival for participants with no, mild, and moderate to severe cognitive impairment was 138, 106, and 63 months, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Cognition was assessed only at enrollment by using a screening instrument. Participants were drawn from a single safety-net health system and had low educational and socioeconomic status, which limits generalizability to other populations. Changes in cognition, function, and comorbid conditions were not measured over time. CONCLUSION: Both mild and moderate to severe cognitive impairment as identified by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire are associated with an increased risk for mortality.

0;Cognitive impairment and mortality in older primary care patients.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of cognitive impairment on mortality in older primary care patients after controlling for confounding effects of demographic and comorbid chronic conditions. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic primary care group practice. PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven patients age 60 and older who completed the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) during routine office visits. MEASUREMENTS: Cognitive impairment measured at baseline using the SPMSQ, demographics, problem drinking, history of smoking, clinical data (including weight, cholesterol level, and serum albumin), and comorbid chronic conditions collected at baseline. survival time measured during the 5 to 7 years after baseline. RESULTS: Eight hundred and eighty-six patients (22.4%) died during the 5 to 7 years of follow-up. Cognitive impairment was categorized as having no impairment (84.3%), mild impairment (10.5%), and moderate-to-severe impairment (5.2%) based on SPMSQ score. Chi-square tests revealed that patients with moderate-to-severe impairment were significantly more likely to die compared with patients with mild impairment (40.8% vs 21.5%) and those with no impairment (40.8% vs 21.4%). No significant difference in crude mortality was found between patients with no impairment and those with mild impairment. After analyzing time to death using the Kaplan-Meier method, patients with moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment were at increased risk of death compared with those with no or mild impairment (Log-rank chi(2) = 55.5. P <.0001). Even in multivariable analyses using Cox proportional hazards to control for confounding factors, compared with those with no impairment, moderately-to-severely impaired patients had an increased risk of death, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.70. Increased risk of death was also associated with older age (HR = 1.03 for each year), a history of smoking (HR = 1.48), having a serum albumin level <3.5 g/L (HR = 1.29), and weighing less than 90% of the ideal body weight (HR = 1.98). Outpatient diagnoses associated with increased mortality risk were diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, anemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR range 1.36-1.67). Factors protective of mortality risk included female gender (HR = 0.67) and black race (HR = 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment is associated with an increased risk of mortality, even after controlling for confounding effects of demographic and clinical characteristics. Mild cognitive impairment is not associated with mortality risk, but a longer follow-up period may be necessary to identify this risk if it exists.;J Am Geriatr Soc. 2001 Jul.49(7):934-40.;Stump TE1, Callahan CM, Hendrie HC.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Academic Medical Centers,Aged/statistics & numerical data*,Cognition Disorders/classification,Cognition Disorders/complications*,Cognition Disorders/diagnosis,Cognition Disorders/mortality*,Comorbidity,Confounding Factors (Epidemiology),Family Practice/statistics & numerical data*,Female,Geriatric Assessment,Group Practice/statistics & numerical data*,Group Practice/utilization,Humans,Indiana/epidemiology,Male,Mass Screening,Mental Status Schedule,Multivariate Analysis,Primary Health Care/statistics & numerical data*,Primary Health Care/utilization,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Risk Factors,Severity of Illness Index,Surveys and Questionnaires,Survival Analysis,K07 AG000868/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States,K07 AG00868/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Clinical decision support system for early detection of prostate cancer from benign hyperplasia of prostate.;Abstract There has been a growing research interest in the use of intelligent methods in medical informatics studies. Intelligent computer programs were implemented to aid physicians and other medical professionals in making difficult medical decisions. Prostate Neoplasia problems including benign hyperplasia and cancer of prostate are very common and cause significant delay in recovery and often require costly investigations before coming to its diagnosis. The conventional approach to build medical diagnostic system requires the formulation of rules by which the input data can be analyzed. But the formulation of such rules is very difficult with large sets of input data. Realizing the difficulty, a number of quantitative mathematical and statistical models including pattern classification technique such as Artificial neural networks (ANN), rolled based system, discriminate analysis and regression analysis has been applied as an alternative to conventional clinical and medical diagnostic. Among the mathematical and statistical modeling techniques used in medical decision support, Artificial neural networks attract many attentions in recent studies and in the last decade, the use of neural networks has become widely accepted in medical applications. This is manifested by an increasing number of medical devices currently available on the market with embedded AI algorithms, together with an accelerating pace of publication in medical journals, with over 500 academic publications year featuring Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).;Stud Health Technol Inform. 2013.192:928.;Ghaderzadeh M1.;Algorithms*,Artificial Intelligence*,Decision Support Systems, Clinical*,Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/methods*,Diagnosis, Differential,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Humans,Male,Prostatic Hyperplasia/diagnosis*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Clinical analysis of 64 patients with lung-cancer-associated hypercalcemia.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the factors influencing survival time of patients with lung-cancer-associated hypercalcemia. DATA AND METHODS: A total of 64 pathologically confirmed patients with Stage IV lung-cancer-associated hypercalcemia were enrolled from Beijing Hospitals between August 2010 and July 2015. Clinical materials included patients' gender, age, pathological type, highest albumin-corrected calcium level, serum alkaline phosphatase level, creatinine clearance rate, organ (bone, liver, brain, and adrenal gland) metastasis, number of distal metastatic sites, and survival time after diagnosis of hypercalcemia. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to screen the risk factors affecting patients' survival. RESULTS: Albumin-corrected calcium levels of the 64 patients ranged from 2.56 to 4.57 mmol/L, and the median value was 2.76 mmol/L. Survival time after diagnosis of hypercalcemia varied from 1 to 1340 days, and the median survival time was 104 days. Univariate analysis showed that gender, age (>60-year-old), albumin-corrected calcium levels, elevation of alkaline phosphatases, brain metastasis, and number of distal metastatic sites were predictors for poor survival (P = 0.026, P = 0.022, P < 0.001, P = 0.043, P = 0.041, P = 0.003). In Cox proportional hazard model analysis, corrected hypercalcemia levels and alkaline phosphatase levels were determined to be risk factors affecting patients' survival time (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.828, P = 0.000. HR = 1.957, P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Stage IV lung-cancer-associated moderate and severe hypercalcemia exhibited shorter survival time and poor prognosis. After correction, moderate and severe elevations of hypercalcemia and abnormal elevation of alkaline phosphatase levels were shown to be significant factors shortening patients' survival time.;J Cancer Res Ther. 2015 Nov.11 Suppl:C275-9. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.170539.;Li X, Bie Z, Zhang Z, Li Y, Hu X, Liu W, Zhang S, Cheng G, Ai B1.;Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Bone Neoplasms/complications,Bone Neoplasms/mortality*,Bone Neoplasms/secondary,Brain Neoplasms/mortality*,Brain Neoplasms/pathology,Brain Neoplasms/secondary,Female,Humans,Hypercalcemia/etiology,Hypercalcemia/mortality*,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Lung Neoplasms/complications,Lung Neoplasms/mortality*,Lung Neoplasms/pathology,Male,Middle Aged,Multivariate Analysis,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models,Retrospective Studies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Classifying tissue samples from measurements on cells with within-class tissue sample heterogeneity.;Abstract We consider here the problem of classifying a macro-level object based on measurements of embedded (micro-level) observations within each object, for example, classifying a patient based on measurements on a collection of a random number of their cells. Classification problems with this hierarchical, nested structure have not received the same statistical understanding as the general classification problem. Some heuristic approaches have been developed and a few authors have proposed formal statistical models. We focus on the problem where heterogeneity exists between the macro-level objects within a class. We propose a model-based statistical methodology that models the log-odds of the macro-level object belonging to a class using a latent-class variable model to account for this heterogeneity. The latent classes are estimated by clustering the macro-level object density estimates. We apply this method to the detection of patients with cervical neoplasia based on quantitative cytology measurements on cells in a Papanicolaou smear. Quantitative cytology is much cheaper and potentially can take less time than the current standard of care. The results show that the automated quantitative cytology using the proposed method is roughly equivalent to clinical cytopathology and shows significant improvement over a statistical model that does not account for the heterogeneity of the data.;Biostatistics. 2011 Oct.12(4):695-709. doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxr010.

0;Classification of Breast Cancer Resistant Protein (BCRP) Inhibitors and Non-Inhibitors Using Machine Learning Approaches.;Abstract The breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) is an important transporter and its inhibitors play an important role in cancer treatment by improving the oral bioavailability as well as blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability of anticancer drugs. In this work, a computational model was developed to predict the compounds as BCRP inhibitors or non-inhibitors. Various machine learning approaches like, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to develop the models. The Matthews correlation coefficients (MCC) of developed models using ANN, k-NN and SVM are 0.67, 0.71 and 0.77, and prediction accuracies are 85.2%, 88.3% and 90.8% respectively. The developed models were tested with a test set of 99 compounds and further validated with external set of 98 compounds. Distribution plot analysis and various machine learning models were also developed based on druglikeness descriptors. Applicability domain is used to check the prediction reliability of the new molecules.;Comb Chem High Throughput Screen. 2015.18(5):476-85.;Belekar V, Lingineni K, Garg P1.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Sub-Family G, Member 2,ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors*,Humans,Machine Learning*,Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors*,Neural Networks (Computer),ABCG2 protein, human,ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Sub-Family G, Member 2,ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters,Neoplasm Proteins;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Classification accuracy of claims-based methods for identifying providers failing to meet performance targets.;Abstract Quality assessment is critical for healthcare reform, but data sources are lacking for measurement of many important healthcare outcomes. With over 49 million people covered by Medicare as of 2010, Medicare claims data offer a potentially valuable source that could be used in targeted health care quality improvement efforts. However, little is known about the operating characteristics of provider profiling methods using claims-based outcome measures that may estimate provider performance with error. Motivated by the example of screening mammography performance, we compared approaches to identifying providers failing to meet guideline targets using Medicare claims data. We used data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium and linked Medicare claims to compare claims-based and clinical estimates of cancer detection rate. We then demonstrated the performance of claim-based estimates across a broad range of operating characteristics using simulation studies. We found that identification of poor performing providers was extremely sensitive to algorithm specificity, with no approach identifying more than 65% of poor performing providers when claims-based measures had specificity of 0.995 or less. We conclude that claims have the potential to contribute important information on healthcare outcomes to quality improvement efforts. However, to achieve this potential, development of highly accurate claims-based outcome measures should remain a priority.;Stat Med. 2015 Jan 15.34(1):93-105. doi: 10.1002/sim.6318.

0;Clarifying the positive association between education and prostate cancer: a Monte Carlo simulation approach.;Abstract Using the 1993-2011 data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (N = 5,218), we examine prostate cancer screening, mortality after the diagnosis, and health behaviors as potential mechanisms explaining the paradoxical association between men's higher education and higher prostate cancer risk. Our study combines within-cohort longitudinal hazard models predicting a prostate cancer diagnosis with Monte Carlo simulations estimating the joint effects of socioeconomic differences in prostate cancer screening and mortality after the diagnosis. Our findings strongly suggest that higher utilization of prostate cancer screening and lower mortality after the diagnosis are important explanations for higher prostate rates among more educated men. In addition to applying an innovative method to the issues of prostate cancer incidence and survival, our results have potentially important implications for the current debate about the utility of prostate cancer screening as well as for accurate predictions of future mortality and morbidity trends in the expanding older population.;J Appl Gerontol. 2015 Apr.34(3):293-316. doi: 10.1177/0733464812473798.

0;Cigarette smoking and risk of fatal breast cancer.;Abstract The authors examined the association of fatal breast cancer and cigarette smoking in a large, prospective mortality study of US adults. After 6 years of follow-up, 880 cases of fatal breast cancer were observed in a cohort of 604,412 women who were cancer-free at interview in 1982. Cox proportional hazards modeling, adjusted for other risk factors, found that current smoking was significantly related to fatal breast cancer risk (adjusted rate ratio (RR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.50). A negative association was observed for former smokers, but this was not statistically significant (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.70-1.03). The association of current smoking with fatal breast cancer risk increased with increasing numbers of cigarettes per day and with total number of years smoked. For smokers of 40 or more cigarettes per day, the rate ratio was 1.74 (95% CI 1.15-2.62). The authors hypothesize that these results may be due to either a poorer prognosis among breast cancer cases who smoke or a delayed diagnosis among current smokers who do not receive mammograms as often as never or former smokers. Women who smoke should be targeted for breast cancer screening services.;Am J Epidemiol. 1994 May 15.139(10):1001-7.;Calle EE1, Miracle-McMahill HL, Thun MJ, Heath CW Jr.;Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/etiology*,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Mammography,Middle Aged,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Risk Factors,Smoking/adverse effects*,Surveys and Questionnaires,United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Childhood IQ, social class, deprivation, and their relationships with mortality and morbidity risk in later life: prospective observational study linking the Scottish Mental Survey 1932 and the Midspan studies.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To investigate how childhood mental ability (IQ) is related to mortality and morbidity risk, when socioeconomic factors are also considered. METHODS: Participants were from the Midspan studies conducted on adults in the 1970s. 938 Midspan participants were successfully matched with the Scottish Mental Survey 1932 in which children born in 1921 and attending Scottish schools on June 1, 1932, took a cognitive ability test. Mortality, hospital admissions, and cancer incidence in the 25 years after the Midspan screening were investigated in relation to childhood IQ, social class, and deprivation. RESULTS: The risk of dying in 25 years was 17% higher for each standard deviation disadvantage in childhood IQ. Adjustment for social class and deprivation category accounted for some, but not all, of this higher risk, reducing it to 12%. Analysis by IQ quartile showed a substantial increased risk of death for the lowest-scoring quarter only. Structural equation modeling indicated that the effect of childhood IQ on mortality was partly indirectly influenced by social factors. Cause-specific mortality or hospital admission showed that lower IQ was associated with higher risks for all cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. Cause-specific mortality or cancer incidence risk was higher with decreasing IQ for lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Lower childhood IQ was related to higher mortality risk and some specific causes of death or morbidity. Childhood IQ may be considered as a marker for risk of death or illness in later life in similar and complementary ways to social class or deprivation category.;Psychosom Med. 2003 Sep-Oct.65(5):877-83.;Hart CL1, Taylor MD, Davey Smith G, Whalley LJ, Starr JM, Hole DJ, Wilson V, Deary IJ.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality,Cause of Death,Child,Cognition,Cohort Studies,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Health Surveys,Hospitalization/statistics & numerical data,Humans,Intelligence*,Male,Morbidity*,Mortality*,Neoplasms/epidemiology,Physical Examination,Proportional Hazards Models,Psychosocial Deprivation*,Respiration Disorders/mortality,Risk,Scotland/epidemiology,Social Class*,Surveys and Questionnaires;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Characterizing the impact of 25 years of DCIS treatment.;Abstract The significant increase in the detection and treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) since the introduction of screening mammography has not been accompanied by the anticipated reduction in invasive breast cancer (IBC) incidence. The prevalence of DCIS requires a reexamination of the population level effects of detecting and treating DCIS. To further our understanding of the possible impact of DCIS diagnosis and treatment on IBC incidence in the U.S., we simulated breast cancer incidence over 25 years under various assumptions regarding the baseline incidence of IBC and the progression of DCIS to IBC. The simulations demonstrate a tradeoff between the expected increased incidence of IBC absent any DCIS detection and treatment and the rate of progression of DCIS to IBC. Our analyses indicate that a high progression of DCIS to IBC implies a significant increase in incidence of IBC over what is observed had we not detected and treated DCIS. Conversely, if we assume that there would not have been a significant increase over and above the observed incidence evident in SEER, then our model indicates that the rate of DCIS progression to clinically significant IBC is low. Given the tradeoff illustrated by our model, we must reevaluate the assumption that DCIS is a short-term obligate precursor of invasive cancer and instead focus on further exploration of the true natural history of DCIS.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2011 Aug.129(1):165-73. doi: 10.1007/s10549-011-1430-5.

0;Chapter 7: Description of MISCAN-lung, the Erasmus MC Lung Cancer microsimulation model for evaluating cancer control interventions.;Abstract The MISCAN-lung model was designed to simulate population trends in lung cancer (LC) for comprehensive surveillance of the disease, to relate past exposure to risk factors to (observed) LC incidence and mortality, and to estimate the impact of cancer-control interventions. MISCAN-lung employs the technique of stochastic microsimulation of life histories affected by risk factors. It includes the two-stage clonal expansion model for carcinogenesis and a detailed LC progression model. the latter is specifically intended for the evaluation of screenings. This article elucidates further the principles of MISCAN-lung and describes its application to a comparative study within the CISNET Lung Working Group on the impact of tobacco control on U.S. LC mortality. MISCAN-lung yields an estimate of the number of LC deaths avoided during 1975-2000. The potential number of avoidable LC deaths, had everybody quit smoking in 1965, is 2.2 million. 750,000 deaths (30%) were avoided in the United States due to actual tobacco control interventions. The model fits in the actual tobacco-control scenario, providing credibility to the estimates of other scenarios, although considering survey-reported smoking trends alone has limitations.;Risk Anal. 2012 Jul.32 Suppl 1:S85-98. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01752.x.;Schultz FW1, Boer R, de Koning HJ.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cohort Studies,Computer Simulation,Female,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Lung Neoplasms/mortality,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Netherlands,Public Health,Risk Factors,Smoking/adverse effects,Software,Stochastic Processes,Tobacco Products,United States,U01 CA097416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,5U01CA097416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This model is used to simulate lung cancer mortality in the U.S. population under the three scenarios of CISNET lung group's smoking base case project in order to estimate the effect of tobacco control policy on lung cancer mortality rates. Simulation results show that tobacco control policies have achieved 35% of the reduction in lung cancer mortality that would have resulted from cessation of all smoking in 1965.;Risk Anal. 2012 Jul.32 Suppl 1:S142-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01741.x.;Foy M1, Deng L, Spitz M, Gorlova O, Kimmel M.;Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Algorithms,Calibration,Case-Control Studies,Computer Simulation,Female,Humans,Incidence,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Male,Mass Screening/methods,Middle Aged,Risk,Smoking/adverse effects*,Smoking/epidemiology,Smoking/mortality,Texas;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Changing patterns in breast cancer incidence trends.;Abstract Incidence rates for breast cancer in U.S. women have steadily increased for decades, but the reasons are not well understood. A recent upturn in these trends suggests that one component may be the effect of more aggressive screening in the population. The age-period-cohort framework, in which the temporal components associated with year of diagnosis and generation are evaluated, can assist in interpreting the elements associated with these trends. A unique approach for exploring other ways of partitioning the contribution of the different temporal components is described and applied to breast cancer incidence data (ICDO 174.0-174.9) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries. Single-year intervals for age and year of diagnosis were used to fit models that provide estimates of the trends associated with the individual temporal elements. A log-linear model for age, period, and cohort was fitted using Poisson regression, and estimates of the separate time trends were calculated. The trends with period increased after 1982, when more aggressive screening began, and the trend is steeper for women older than 40 years. Cohort trends have increased steadily, although recent cohorts appear to be somewhat flat for women aged 50 years or younger, whereas the trend for those older than 50 years have continued to increase. Estimates of cohort trends in rates are also provided by extrapolating what would have occurred had there been no period trend before or after 1982, thus providing an estimate of the magnitude of the upturn that occurred after the recent emphasis on screening.;J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2006.(36):19-25.;Holford TR1, Cronin KA, Mariotto AB, Feuer EJ.;Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Incidence,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Poisson Distribution,Predictive Value of Tests,Regression Analysis,Risk Factors,SEER Program/statistics & numerical data*,Survival Rate,United States/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Changes in breast cancer mortality in Navarre (Spain) after introduction of a screening programme.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess changes in the trend of breast cancer mortality in Navarre, and the effect that a screening programme may have had on these changes. METHODS: A breast cancer screening programme targeting women aged 45-65 years was launched in Navarre in September 1990. Breast cancer deaths between 1975 and 2004 were identified from the Navarre Mortality Registry, and the date of diagnosis was obtained by linkage with the population-based Navarre Cancer Registry. We compared breast cancer mortality during the pre-screening (1987-89) and screening (2002-04) periods, and with the estimated rate in the last period calculated by a linear model with a Poisson distribution. The long-term trends (from 1975 through 2004) were described by joinpoint regression analysis. Prevalent cases (those diagnosed before 1991) were excluded to minimize dilution of the benefit in the post-screening period due to deaths from tumours diagnosed before screening began. RESULTS: The joinpoint analysis showed a rising trend in breast cancer mortality rates until 1994, followed by a continual decrease of just over 5% per year. A comparison of mortality rates between the last pre-screening and the screening periods showed a decrease of 36% (95% confidence interval [CI] 21-48%), with the largest reduction in the 50-69 years age group (52%. CI: 33-65%). In this age group, mortality in the 2002-04 period was 62% lower than that projected from extrapolation of the pre-screening trend, while in unscreened age groups (30-44 and > or =75 years), mortality was only 22% lower. When prevalent tumours were excluded, the 50-69 years age group presented a further decrease in mortality than when all tumours were considered. CONCLUSIONS: Fourteen years after the introduction of a screening programme, a major reduction in breast cancer mortality has been observed.;J Med Screen. 2007.14(1):14-20.;Ascunce EN1, Moreno-Iribas C, Barcos Urtiaga A, Ardanaz E, Ederra Sanz M, Castilla J, Egüés N.;Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Carcinoma/mortality*,Female,Humans,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Spain/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Cervical cancer mortality trends in Brazil, 1981-2006.;Abstract The aim of this study was to describe cervical cancer mortality trends in Brazil for the period 1981-2006. Cervical cancer mortality was corrected on the basis of proportional redistribution of the deaths from malignant neoplasm of uterus, part unspecified. Time trends were evaluated by means of simple linear regression. After correction, cervical cancer ranked second among the leading causes of death from cancer in the female population up to 2005, with a downward trend for the country as a whole, a decline in the State capitals, and a stable trend in the municipalities in the interior. A downward trend was confirmed in the State capitals in all geographic regions of the country. In the municipalities in the interior, there was an increase in the North and Northeast regions, a decline in the Southeast and South, and a stable trend in the Central-West. Although uneven, the decline began to take consistent shape in the country. Even better results could be achieved by investing in the expansion of screening coverage, especially among the populations at greatest risk.;Cad Saude Publica. 2010 Dec.26(12):2399-407.;Azevedo e Silva G1, Girianelli VR, Gamarra CJ, Bustamante-Teixeira MT.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Brazil/epidemiology,Cities/epidemiology,Cluster Analysis,Female,Humans,Linear Models,Mortality/trends,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/mortality*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Cerebral metastasis and other central nervous system complications of pleuropulmonary blastoma.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is a rare tumor of pleura and lung in young children. Central nervous system (CNS) complications, particularly cerebral parenchymal metastases, occur in aggressive forms of PPB: Types II and III PPB. This article evaluates cerebral and meningeal metastases, cerebrovascular events (CVA) caused by tumor emboli, spinal cord complications, and intracranial second malignancies in PPB. PROCEDURE: International PPB Registry and literature cases were evaluated for CNS events. Cerebral metastasis patients were evaluated for gender, side of origin of PPB, PPB Type, interval from diagnosis to metastasis, status of chest disease, treatment, and outcome. Standard statistical methods were used to calculate the cumulative probability of cerebral metastasis and survival following metastasis. RESULTS: Thirty-nine cases of cerebral metastasis were identified in 5/53 Registry Type II cases, 15/44 Registry Type III cases, and 19/143 literature Type II/III cases. Metastases occurred 1-60, median 11.5 months after diagnosis. Chest disease was controlled in 50% of children at time of metastasis. The cumulative probability of cerebral metastasis by 5 years from diagnosis was 11% for Type II patients (95%CI (confidence interval): 2-20%) and 54% for Type III patients (95%CI: 31-76%). Seven children survive cerebral metastasis. Other CNS complications were post-operative CVA (five cases), spinal cord invasion or compression (six), leptomeningeal disease (three), and second intracranial malignancies (two). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral metastasis is more frequent in PPB than in other childhood sarcomas. Clinicians should screen for this complication. Diverse other CNS complications are less common and require careful diagnosis.

1;Can Streamlined Multicriteria Decision Analysis Be Used to Implement Shared Decision Making for Colorectal Cancer Screening?;Abstract BACKGROUND: Current US colorectal cancer screening guidelines that call for shared decision making regarding the choice among several recommended screening options are difficult to implement. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an established method well suited for supporting shared decision making. Our study goal was to determine whether a streamlined form of MCDA using rank-order-based judgments can accurately assess patients' colorectal cancer screening priorities. METHODS: We converted priorities for 4 decision criteria and 3 subcriteria regarding colorectal cancer screening obtained from 484 average-risk patients using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in a prior study into rank-order-based priorities using rank order centroids. We compared the 2 sets of priorities using Spearman rank correlation and nonparametric Bland-Altman limits of agreement analysis. We assessed the differential impact of using the rank-order-based versus the AHP-based priorities on the results of a full MCDA comparing 3 currently recommended colorectal cancer screening strategies. Generalizability of the results was assessed using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Correlations between the 2 sets of priorities for the 7 criteria ranged from 0.55 to 0.92. The proportions of differences between rank-order-based and AHP-based priorities that were more than ±0.15 ranged from 1% to 16%. Differences in the full MCDA results were minimal, and the relative rankings of the 3 screening options were identical more than 88% of the time. The Monte Carlo simulation results were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Rank-order-based MCDA could be a simple, practical way to guide individual decisions and assess population decision priorities regarding colorectal cancer screening strategies. Additional research is warranted to further explore the use of these methods for promoting shared decision making. © The Author(s) 2013.;Med Decis Making. 2014 Aug.34(6):746-55. doi: 10.1177/0272989X13513338.

METHODS: A Markov model of cervical cancer was calibrated to recent age-specific US data on the prevalence of cervical abnormalities, cervical cancer incidence, and related mortality. The impact of failing to account for temporal changes in screening practices was assessed by comparing results from 1) a conventional calibration that incorrectly assumed that all women had been exposed to current screening practices in the past and 2) an historically accurate calibration that reflected the fact that US women 65 years of age and older had not received currently available screening practices at younger ages. RESULTS: The parameter set derived from conventional calibration produced a cervical cancer incidence rate of 13.4 per 100,000 among women aged 65 years and older, which is equal to the target end point. However, when this parameter set was used in the model to simulate the effects of historically correct screening, cervical incidence and related mortality in the 65 years and older age group were overestimated by 18% and 47%, respectively. Finally, when the parameter set was correctly calibrated by assuming historical changes in screening in the calibration process, excellent calibration to both incidence and mortality was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Calibrating longitudinal models to cross-sectional data without accounting for temporal changes in clinical practice may result in a parameter set that is not as optimized as it appears and may lead to bias in evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.

1;Building a model to determine the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening in France.;Abstract This paper describes the methods and initial validation of a cost-effectiveness model developed to simulate the breast cancer screening situation in France. The first screening pilot programmes were set up in France in 1989 to test the feasibility of a decentralized screening model based in a large number of existing non-dedicated radiology centres. The present cost-effectiveness model was built as a tool to help guide current policy discussions on the future of screening in France. This Markov model compares the costs and effects expected when a screening programme is offered to a given cohort of women to those expected in the absence of screening. The model was initially validated using current results from the Bas-Rhin screening programme and local cancer registry epidemiological data. Over a 20-year period, 315 274 women would attend for screening, of whom 12 491 would be recalled for further assessment. 4423 cancers would be detected, resulting in 637 deaths. Screening allows the detection of 106 additional cancer cases, thereby preventing 92 deaths, and saves 1522 life-years compared with a situation without screening. Breast cancer mortality is reduced by 12.6%, yielding a cost-effectiveness ratio of 137 000 FF per life-year saved. The results of initial analyses suggest that the model is capable of suitably assessing the impact of breast cancer screening in terms of costs and effects. Further scenario analyses are needed to understand the impact of screening policy changes on the costs and effectiveness of future screening programmes.;Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2003 Jun.12(2):143-53.;Arveux P1, Wait S, Schaffer P.;Validation Studies,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cohort Studies,Costs and Cost Analysis,Female,France,Humans,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Breast self-examination proficiency in older women: measuring the efficacy of video self-instruction kits.;Abstract Older women represent the highest risk group for breast cancer but do not use screening at recommended frequencies. Age-sensitive screening programs addressing the developmental issues, unique value systems, and problems of access for all older women are critically needed. Television is an ideal medium for reaching isolated older women with health information and educational programs. This research explored the efficacy of using video self-instruction kits to increase breast self-examination (BSE) proficiency and knowledge about breast cancer among a sample of 62 women > 60 years of age. Participants were given breast health kits containing an instructional video, printed educational materials, a miniature lump model, and BSE skill checks. Before using the kits and 30 days later they were tested on measures of BSE proficiency and knowledge about breast cancer. Results indicate that the self-instruction programs had significant and positive impacts on the two BSE proficiency measures: skill demonstrations (t = 7.32, p < 0.0001) and lump detection using a simulation model (t = 4.23, p < 0.0001). Knowledge about breast cancer scores also improved from pretest to posttest. Implications for cancer nurses and direct outcomes from the research including newly designed instructional media materials are discussed.;Cancer Nurs. 1996 Dec.19(6):429-36.;Wood RY1.;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Age Factors,Aged,Breast Self-Examination/standards*,Educational Measurement,Feasibility Studies,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Patient Education as Topic/standards*,Programmed Instruction as Topic/standards*,Videotape Recording/standards*,1 R43 CA 63935-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Breast cancer survival and health iniquities.;Abstract Breast cancer is the most frequent neoplasm in women, and some studies have shown social inequalities in incidence and survival, which are poorly investigated in Brazil. To assess iniquity in prognosis, a hospital-based cohort study was carried out. Follow-up was made by active search in medical records and in the Mortality Information System, phone calls, and consultation on Individual Tax-Collection Record status. Survival functions were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazards model was employed for prognostic assessment. Disease-specific survival was estimated at 76.3% (95%CI: 71.9-81.0) in 5 years. Women seen at public facilities had worse prognosis (HR = 1.79. 95%CI: 1.09-2.94), which was particularly due to the disease being diagnosed at a more advanced stage. These findings point to inequalities of access to screening actions, as women of lower social conditions with later diagnostic and therefore with worse prognostic.;Cad Saude Publica. 2015 Aug.31(8):1673-84. doi: 10.1590/0102-311X00145214.;Guerra MR1, Silva GA2, Nogueira MC1, Leite IC1, Oliveira Rde V3, Cintra JR4, Bustamante-Teixeira MT1.;Brazil/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Female,Healthcare Disparities/statistics & numerical data*,Humans,Incidence,Middle Aged,Prognosis,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Factors,Socioeconomic Factors,Survival Analysis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Breast cancer screening: the role of attachment.;Abstract Attachment style is the dispositional way in which a person relates to others, and differences in attachment characteristics may offer insight into why many women do not adhere to breast screening guidelines. While mammograms involve contact with medical professionals, breast self-examination (BSE) does not, and may be preferable for women who dislike interpersonal vulnerability. As such, differences in the attachment characteristics that predict mammography versus BSE utilisation may indicate whether attachment related motivations are relevant to both interpersonal examinations and independent self-care behaviours. The current report examined how attachment dimensions predicted the frequency of mammography and BSE in a sample of 1204 ethnically diverse women from Brooklyn, New York. Participants completed measures of mammography and BSE frequency, and attachment, together with demographic, health care context and emotional predictors of screening. Multiple regressions showed that attachment dimensions predicted both mammography and BSE screening even when controlling for established predictors and emotion relevant variables. As hypothesised, fearful avoidance predicted fewer mammograms and BSEs, while preoccupation predicted more frequent BSEs. Consistent with some prior work in male cancer screening, greater attachment security also predicted fewer mammograms while degree of dismissiveness was not associated with screening frequencies. Understanding the psychosocial predictors of screening may help identify low screeners, and guide the development of targeted interventions that are better suited to the interpersonal preferences of older women.;Psychol Health Med. 2015.20(4):400-9. doi: 10.1080/13548506.2014.955035.

1;Breast cancer risk prediction model: a nomogram based on common mammographic screening findings.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To develop a prediction model for breast cancer based on common mammographic findings on screening mammograms aiming to reduce reader variability in assigning BI-RADS. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 352 positive screening mammograms of women participating in the Dutch screening programme (Nijmegen region, 2006-2008). The following mammographic findings were assessed by consensus reading of three expert radiologists: masses and mass density, calcifications, architectural distortion, focal asymmetry and mammographic density, and BI-RADS. Data on age, diagnostic workup and final diagnosis were collected from patient records. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to build a breast cancer prediction model, presented as a nomogram. RESULTS: Breast cancer was diagnosed in 108 cases (31 %). The highest positive predictive value (PPV) was found for spiculated masses (96 %) and the lowest for well-defined masses (10 %). Characteristics included in the nomogram are age, mass, calcifications, architectural distortion and focal asymmetry. CONCLUSION: With our nomogram we developed a tool assisting screening radiologists in determining the chance of malignancy based on mammographic findings. We propose cutoff values for assigning BI-RADS in the Dutch programme based on our nomogram, which will need to be validated in future research. These values can easily be adapted for use in other screening programmes. KEY POINTS: • There is substantial reader variability in assigning BI-RADS in mammographic screening. • There are no strict guidelines linking mammographic findings to BI-RADS categories. • We developed a model (nomogram) predicting the presence of breast cancer. • Our nomogram is based on common findings on positive screening mammograms. • The nomogram aims to assist screening radiologists in assigning BI-RADS categories.;Eur Radiol. 2013 Sep.23(9):2413-9. doi: 10.1007/s00330-013-2836-8.

0;Breast cancer risk prediction and mammography biopsy decisions: a model-based study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Controversy continues about screening mammography, in part because of the risk of false-negative and false-positive mammograms. Pre-test breast cancer risk factors may improve the positive and negative predictive value of screening. PURPOSE: To create a model that estimates the potential impact of pre-test risk prediction using clinical and genomic information on the reclassification of women with abnormal mammograms (BI-RADS3 and BI-RADS4 [Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System]) above and below the threshold for breast biopsy. METHODS: The current study modeled 1-year breast cancer risk in women with abnormal screening mammograms using existing data on breast cancer risk factors, 12 validated breast cancer single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and probability of cancer given the BI-RADS category. Examination was made of reclassification of women above and below biopsy thresholds of 1%, 2%, and 3% risk. The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data were collected from 1996 to 2002. Data analysis was conducted in 2010 and 2011. RESULTS: Using a biopsy risk threshold of 2% and the standard risk factor model, 5% of women with a BI-RADS3 mammogram had a risk above the threshold, and 3% of women with BI-RADS4A mammograms had a risk below the threshold. The addition of 12 SNPs in the model resulted in 8% of women with a BI-RADS3 mammogram above the threshold for biopsy and 7% of women with BI-RADS4A mammograms below the threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of pre-test breast cancer risk factors could change biopsy decisions for a small proportion of women with abnormal mammograms. The greatest impact comes from standard breast cancer risk factors. Copyright © 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1;Breast cancer risk assessment in women aged 70 and older.;Abstract Although the benefit of screening mammography for women over 69 has not been established, it is generally agreed that screening recommendations for older women should be individualized based on health status and breast cancer risk. However, statistical models to assess breast cancer risk have not been previously evaluated in this age group. In this study, the original Gail model and three more recent models that include mammographic breast density as a risk factor were applied to a cohort of 19,779 Vermont women aged 70 and older. Women were followed for an average of 7.1 years and 821 developed breast cancer. The predictive accuracy of each risk model was measured by its c-statistic and associations between individual risk factors and breast cancer risk were assessed by Cox regression. C-statistics were 0.54 (95% CI = 0.52-0.56) for the Gail model, 0.54 (95% CI = 0.51-0.56) for the Tice modification of the Gail model, 0.55 (95% CI = 0.53-0.58) for a model developed by Barlow and 0.55 (95% CI = 0.53-0.58) for a Vermont model. These results indicate that the models are not useful for assessing risk in women aged 70 and older. Several risk factors in the models were not significantly associated with outcome in the cohort, while others were significantly related to outcome but had smaller relative risks than estimated by the models. Age-related attenuation of the effects of some risk factors makes the prediction of breast cancer in older women particularly difficult.;Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2011 Nov.130(1):291-9. doi: 10.1007/s10549-011-1576-1.

0;Breast Cancer Knowledge, Perception and Breast Self- Examination Practices among Yemeni Women: an Application of the Health Belief Model.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The incidence of breast cancer is rapidly increasing in Yemen with recent indications of constituting one-third of female cancers. The main problem in Yemen remains very late presentation of breast cancer, most of which should have been easily recognisable. Since stage of disease at diagnosis is the most important prognostic variable, early diagnosis is an important option to be considered for control of breast cancer in low resourced settings like Yemen. In the present study, we aimed at describing breast cancer knowledge, perceptions and breast self-examination (BSE) practices among a sample of Yemeni women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study covered 400 women attending four reproductive health centres in Aden, Yemen through face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire during April - July 2014. We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge about breast cancer, and screening practices as well as respondents' perceptions based on the five sub scales of the Health Belief Model (HBM): perceived susceptibility. perceived severity. perceived barriers. perceived benefits. and self-efficacy. The response format was a fivepoint Likert scale. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 20) was used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Logistic regression analysis was conducted with BSE as a dependent variable. RESULTS: The mean age of women was 26.5 (S.D=5.6) years. The majority (89.0%) had never ever performed any screening. Two-thirds of respondents had poor knowledge. Perceived BSE benefits and self-efficacy and lower BSE barriers perception were significant independent predictors of BSE practice. CONCLUSIONS: Poor knowledge and inadequate BSE practices are prevailing in Yemen. The need for implementing culturally sensitive targeted education measures is mandatory in the effort to improve early detection and reduce the burden of breast cancer.;Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016.17(3):1463-7.;Al-Sakkaf KA1, Basaleem HO.;Adult,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/psychology,Breast Self-Examination/psychology*,Cross-Sectional Studies,Early Detection of Cancer/psychology*,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Health Behavior*,Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice*,Humans,Models, Statistical*,Motivation,Neoplasm Staging,Perception,Prognosis,Risk Factors,Yemen/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Breast cancer incidence: what do the figures mean?;Abstract ABSTRACT RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Against the background of a general rise in the incidence of breast cancer temporal variations appear in different age groups, including changes attributable to the introduction of breast screening. This paper attempts to distinguish the influence of breast screening and to examine any underlying patterns. METHODS: The incidence data published by the Office of National Statistics for England and Wales have been examined using the method of least squares regression. These data have been subjected to major revision: a new system was introduced in 1971. That year, therefore, has been taken as the starting point for the analyses. Regression lines were fitted from 1971, 1984 and 1988 (when breast screening was started). Results Between 1971 and 1984 breast cancer incidence was unchanged in women under 50 years. In all other age groups and time periods the incidence has risen throughout 1971-1999. The rate of increase remained constant for women over 64 but changed in 1984 for all women under 65 years. The rate of increase is rising exponentially with age since 1984 in the women under 65. The superimposed increases due to screening have been separated from the underlying rates. CONCLUSIONS: In the period surveyed there appears to have been a change in the rates of increase in incidence of breast cancer in women under 65 that dates from 1984. This change can be separated from the spurious increase due to breast screening. The rates in women over 64 have remained constant.;J Eval Clin Pract. 2005 Feb.11(1):27-31.;Johnson A1, Shekhdar J.;Adult,Age Distribution,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,England/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Least-Squares Analysis,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Population Surveillance,Wales/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Breast cancer incidence trends in Norway and estimates of overdiagnosis.;Abstract Objective Fluctuations in the incidence of breast cancer in Norway in the last three decades are partly explained by the use of hormone replacement therapy and mammography screening, but overdiagnosis has also been suggested as a cause. We assessed the trends in breast cancer incidence and overdiagnosis in Norway. Methods We calibrated our microsimulation model to Norwegian Cancer Registration data. The model takes into account the use of mammography (both within and outside the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Programme) and of hormone replacement therapy. We obtained a proper fit of breast cancer incidence in recent years, when assuming an increase in the background risk for breast cancer, and estimated overdiagnosis. Results We estimated a 2% overdiagnosis rate as a fraction of all cancers diagnosed in women aged 50-100, and a 3% overdiagnosis rate as a fraction of all cancers diagnosed in women aged 50-70 (i.e. screening age). If all of the increased incidence would be the result of the detection of slow growing tumours, these estimates were 7% and 11%, respectively. Conclusion Besides mammography and hormone replacement therapy use, additional risk factors contributed to the sudden increase in breast cancer incidence in Norway. Overdiagnosis estimates due to screening were within the range of international plausible estimates.;J Med Screen. 2017 Jun.24(2):83-91. doi: 10.1177/0969141316668379.

0;Breast cancer incidence and case fatality among 4.7 million women in relation to social and ethnic background: a population-based cohort study.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: Incidence of breast cancer is increasing around the world and it is still the leading cause of cancer mortality in low- and middle-income countries. We utilized Swedish nationwide registers to study breast cancer incidence and case fatality to disentangle the effect of socioeconomic position (SEP) and immigration from the trends in native Swedes. METHODS: A nation-wide cohort of women in Sweden was followed between 1961 and 2007 and incidence rate ratio (IRR) and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Poisson and Cox proportional regression models, respectively. RESULTS: Incidence continued to increase. however, it remained lower among immigrants (IRR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.86 to 0.90) but not among immigrants' daughters (IRR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.94 to 1.01) compared to native Swedes. Case fatality decreased over the last decades and was similar in native Swedes and immigrants. However, case fatality was significantly 14% higher if cancer was diagnosed after age 50 and 20% higher if cancer was diagnosed in the most recent years among immigrants compared with native Swedes. Women with the highest SEP had significantly 20% to 30% higher incidence but had 30% to 40% lower case fatality compared with women with the lowest SEP irrespective of country of birth. Age at immigration and duration of residence significantly modified the incidence and case fatality. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities found in case fatality among immigrants by age, duration of residence, age at immigration and country of birth emphasize the importance of targeting interventions on women that are not likely to attend screenings or are not likely to adhere to the therapy suggested by physicians. The lower risk of breast cancer among immigrant women calls for more knowledge about how the lifestyle factors in these women differ from those with high risk, so that preventative measures may be implemented.;Breast Cancer Res. 2012 Jan 6.14(1):R5.;Beiki O1, Hall P, Ekbom A, Moradi T.;Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Emigrants and Immigrants,Female,Humans,Incidence,Middle Aged,Poisson Distribution,Proportional Hazards Models,Risk Factors,Social Class*,Sweden/epidemiology,Young Adult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Breast cancer diagnosis, patterns of care and burden of disease in Queensland, Australia (1998-2004): does being Indigenous make a difference?;Abstract OBJECTIVES: We compared patterns of care, comorbidity, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and survival in Indigenous and non-Indigenous women with breast cancer in Queensland, Australia (1998-2004). METHODS: A cohort study of Indigenous (n = 110) and non-Indigenous women (n = 105), frequency matched on age and remoteness. We used Pearson's Chi-squared analysis to compare proportions, hazard models to assess survival differences and calculated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). RESULTS: Indigenous women were more likely to be socially disadvantaged (43 vs. 20 %, p < 0.01) have comorbidity (42 vs. 18 % p < 0.01), and have regional spread or distant metastasis (metastasis, 51 vs. 36 %, p = 0.02) than non-Indigenous women. there was no difference in treatment patterns. More Indigenous women died in the follow-up period (p = 0.01). DALY's were 469 and 665 per 100,000 for Indigenous and non-Indigenous women, respectively, with a larger proportion of the burden attributed to premature death among the former (63 vs. 59 %). CONCLUSIONS: Indigenous women with breast cancer received comparable treatment to their non-Indigenous counterparts. The higher proportion of DALYs related to early death in Indigenous women suggests higher fatality with breast cancer in this group. Later stage at diagnosis and higher comorbidity presence among Indigenous women reinforce the need for early detection and improved management of co-existing disease.;Int J Public Health. 2016 May.61(4):435-42. doi: 10.1007/s00038-015-0739-y.

0;Blinded review of Papanicolaou smears in the context of litigation.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Blinded review has been endorsed by several cytology and pathology organizations as the most appropriate method for the review of cervicovaginal specimens in the context of litigation. Methods for determining the statistical validity of this method were evaluated. METHODS: First, the authors calculated the sample size needed to detect various differences in case difficulty or ease of interpretation, in which ease of interpretation is defined as the percentage of the time a case could be identified as abnormal by routine screening. Very easy cases could be identified most reliably, whereas more difficult cases were detected less regularly and less reliably. Using construct sample sizes, the authors calculated the number of abnormal reviews that may be helpful to conclude that the case's difficulty or ease of interpretation was statistically significantly different from another case of a specified difficulty. Finally, they examined the effect of using two separate cutoff parameters to make these distinctions. RESULTS: Depending on the threshold chosen, it was determined that improvements in the statistically meaningful distinctions may be made using 15 or 20 reviews. To distinguish between routine false-negative cases (ease of detection, 40%) and routine cases (ease of detection, 80%), the thresholds may be set at 5 of 10 reviews (a case that would not be detected regularly and reliably in any given laboratory) and 7 of 10 reviews (defining a case that would be identified regularly and reliably), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The authors provide data that can be used to interpret the results of a blinded review in a statistically appropriate manner. To improve the utility of blinded reviews, the standards are defined explicitly.

0;Bio-optics based sensation imaging for breast tumor detection using tissue characterization.;Abstract The tissue inclusion parameter estimation method is proposed to measure the stiffness as well as geometric parameters. The estimation is performed based on the tactile data obtained at the surface of the tissue using an optical tactile sensation imaging system (TSIS). A forward algorithm is designed to comprehensively predict the tactile data based on the mechanical properties of tissue inclusion using finite element modeling (FEM). This forward information is used to develop an inversion algorithm that will be used to extract the size, depth, and Young's modulus of a tissue inclusion from the tactile data. We utilize the artificial neural network (ANN) for the inversion algorithm. The proposed estimation method was validated by a realistic tissue phantom with stiff inclusions. The experimental results showed that the proposed estimation method can measure the size, depth, and Young's modulus of a tissue inclusion with 0.58%, 3.82%, and 2.51% relative errors, respectively. The obtained results prove that the proposed method has potential to become a useful screening and diagnostic method for breast cancer.;Sensors (Basel). 2015 Mar 16.15(3):6306-23. doi: 10.3390/s150306306.;Lee JH1, Kim YN2, Park HJ3.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Biosensing Techniques*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Female,Humans,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Optics and Photonics;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Bias in estimating accuracy of a binary screening test with differential disease verification.;Abstract Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value are typically used to quantify the accuracy of a binary screening test. In some studies, it may not be ethical or feasible to obtain definitive disease ascertainment for all subjects using a gold standard test. When a gold standard test cannot be used, an imperfect reference test that is less than 100 per cent sensitive and specific may be used instead. In breast cancer screening, for example, follow-up for cancer diagnosis is used as an imperfect reference test for women where it is not possible to obtain gold standard results. This incomplete ascertainment of true disease, or differential disease verification, can result in biased estimates of accuracy. In this paper, we derive the apparent accuracy values for studies subject to differential verification. We determine how the bias is affected by the accuracy of the imperfect reference test, the percent who receive the imperfect reference standard test not receiving the gold standard, the prevalence of the disease, and the correlation between the results for the screening test and the imperfect reference test. It is shown that designs with differential disease verification can yield biased estimates of accuracy. Estimates of sensitivity in cancer screening trials may be substantially biased. However, careful design decisions, including selection of the imperfect reference test, can help to minimize bias. A hypothetical breast cancer screening study is used to illustrate the problem.;Stat Med. 2011 Jul 10.30(15):1852-64. doi: 10.1002/sim.4232.

1;Benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of supplemental ultrasonography screening for women with dense breasts.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Many states have laws requiring mammography facilities to tell women with dense breasts and negative results on screening mammography to discuss supplemental screening tests with their providers. The most readily available supplemental screening method is ultrasonography, but little is known about its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of supplemental ultrasonography screening for women with dense breasts. DESIGN: Comparative modeling with 3 validated simulation models. DATA SOURCES: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. and medical literature. TARGET POPULATION: Contemporary cohort of women eligible for routine screening. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Payer. INTERVENTION: Supplemental ultrasonography screening for women with dense breasts after a negative screening mammography result. OUTCOME MEASURES: Breast cancer deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, biopsies recommended after a false-positive ultrasonography result, and costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Supplemental ultrasonography screening after a negative mammography result for women aged 50 to 74 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts averted 0.36 additional breast cancer deaths (range across models, 0.14 to 0.75), gained 1.7 QALYs (range, 0.9 to 4.7), and resulted in 354 biopsy recommendations after a false-positive ultrasonography result (range, 345 to 421) per 1000 women with dense breasts compared with biennial screening by mammography alone. The cost-effectiveness ratio was $325,000 per QALY gained (range, $112,000 to $766,000). Supplemental ultrasonography screening for only women with extremely dense breasts cost $246,000 per QALY gained (range, $74,000 to $535,000). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The conclusions were not sensitive to ultrasonography performance characteristics, screening frequency, or starting age. LIMITATION: Provider costs for coordinating supplemental ultrasonography were not considered. CONCLUSION: Supplemental ultrasonography screening for women with dense breasts would substantially increase costs while producing relatively small benefits.

0;Benefits and costs of interventions to improve breast cancer outcomes in African American women.;Abstract PURPOSE: Historically, African American women have experienced higher breast cancer mortality than white women, despite lower incidence. Our objective was to evaluate whether costs of increasing rates of screening or application of intensive treatment will be off-set by survival benefits for African American women. METHODS: We use a stochastic simulation model of the natural history of breast cancer to evaluate the incremental societal costs and benefits of status quo versus targeted biennial screening or treatment improvements among African Americans 40 years of age and older. Main outcome measures were number of mammograms, stage, all-cause mortality, and discounted costs per life year saved (LYS). RESULTS: At the current screening rate of 76%, there is little incremental benefit associated with further increasing screening, and the costs are high: 124,053 US dollars and 124,217 US dollars per LYS for lay health worker and patient reminder interventions, respectively, compared with the status quo. Using reminders would cost 51,537 US dollars per LYS if targeted to virtually unscreened women or 78,130 US dollars per LYS if targeted to women with a two-fold increase in baseline risk. If all patients received the most intensive treatment recommended, costs increase but deaths decrease, for a cost of 52,678 US dollars per LYS. Investments of up to 6,000 US dollars per breast cancer patient could be used to enhance treatment and still yield cost-effectiveness ratios of less than 75,000 US dollars per LYS. CONCLUSION: Except in pockets of unscreened or high-risk women, further investments in interventions to increase screening are unlikely to be an efficient use of resources. Ensuring that African American women receive intensive treatment seems to be the most cost-effective approach to decreasing the disproportionate mortality experienced by this population.;J Clin Oncol. 2004 Jul 1.22(13):2554-66.

0;Beneficial effects of a combined navigator/promotora approach for Hispanic women diagnosed with breast abnormalities.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Patient navigation (PN) is an emerging strategy to overcome barriers to cancer care. We evaluated the efficacy of PN in improving time of key events in cancer care, including positive screening tests, definitive diagnosis, initiation of therapy, and completion of initial therapy. METHODS: We evaluated PN in a prospective observational study of predominantly poor Hispanic women with an abnormal breast cancer screening or untreated biopsy proven breast cancer (control = 200, intervention = 260). Controls were contemporary record-based patients with positive screening. Analyses were conducted for the entire cohort and separately by ethnic strata. We used χ(2) tests to compare differences in proportions and Kaplan-Meier followed by Cox regression to compare time-to-event curves of the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: The average days from definitive diagnosis to initiation of therapy was significantly reduced overall with PN (PN vs. control, 57 vs. 74 days, P = 0.04). This effect was more pronounced in the Hispanic strata (56 vs. 81 days, P = 0.02). More navigated Hispanic women were diagnosed within 60 days of abnormal screening (62.6% vs. 47.5%, P < 0.01) and more began treatment within 60 days of diagnosis (80% vs. 56.3%, P < 0.01). Navigated Hispanic and other ethnic minority women had a shorter time from positive screening test to definitive diagnosis (16 and 32 days, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Minority women may have benefited from navigation with shorter times from definitive diagnosis to initiation of therapy. IMPACT: PN intervention may show promise in decreasing some delays that contribute to health disparities among minority women with breast cancer. 2012 AACR;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2012 Oct.21(10):1639-44. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-0538.;Dudley DJ1, Drake J, Quinlan J, Holden A, Saegert P, Karnad A, Ramirez A.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology,Breast Neoplasms/therapy,Female,Healthcare Disparities,Hispanic Americans,Humans,Kaplan-Meier Estimate,Middle Aged,Patient Navigation*,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Time Factors,U01 CA116885/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U10 CA11685-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Bayesian wombling for spatial point processes.;Abstract In many applications involving geographically indexed data, interest focuses on identifying regions of rapid change in the spatial surface, or the related problem of the construction or testing of boundaries separating regions with markedly different observed values of the spatial variable. This process is often referred to in the literature as boundary analysis or wombling. Recent developments in hierarchical models for point-referenced (geostatistical) and areal (lattice) data have led to corresponding statistical wombling methods, but there does not appear to be any literature on the subject in the point-process case, where the locations themselves are assumed to be random and likelihood evaluation is notoriously difficult. We extend existing point-level and areal wombling tools to this case, obtaining full posterior inference for multivariate spatial random effects that, when mapped, can help suggest spatial covariates still missing from the model. In the areal case we can also construct wombled maps showing significant boundaries in the fitted intensity surface, while the point-referenced formulation permits testing the significance of a postulated boundary. In the computationally demanding point-referenced case, our algorithm combines Monte Carlo approximants to the likelihood with a predictive process step to reduce the dimension of the problem to a manageable size. We apply these techniques to an analysis of colorectal and prostate cancer data from the northern half of Minnesota, where a key substantive concern is possible similarities in their spatial patterns, and whether they are affected by each patient's distance to facilities likely to offer helpful cancer screening options.;Biometrics. 2009 Dec.65(4):1243-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01203.x.;Liang S1, Banerjee S, Carlin BP.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Bayes Theorem*,Biometry/methods*,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Databases, Factual,Demography*,Female,Health Facilities,Humans,Male,Minnesota/epidemiology,Models, Statistical,Monte Carlo Method,Poverty Areas,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology,R01 CA095955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA095955-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA112444-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U55/CCU521991/PHS HHS/United States,R01 CA095955-05A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA112444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,1-R01-CA95955-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,1-R01-CA112 444-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA112444-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Bayesian estimation of a cancer population by capture-recapture with individual capture heterogeneity and small sample.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence and prevalence estimates are necessary to inform health policy, to predict public health impact and to identify etiological factors. Registers have been used to estimate the number of cancer cases. To be reliable and useful, cancer registry data should be complete. Capture-recapture is a method for estimating the number of cases missed, originally developed in ecology to estimate the size of animal populations. Capture recapture methods in cancer epidemiology involve modelling the overlap between lists of individuals using log-linear models. These models rely on assumption of independence of sources and equal catchability between individuals, unlikely to be satisfied in cancer population as severe cases are more likely to be captured than simple cases. METHODS: To estimate cancer population and completeness of cancer registry, we applied M(th) models that rely on parameters that influence capture as time of capture (t) and individual heterogeneity (h) and compared results to the ones obtained with classical log-linear models and sample coverage approach. For three sources collecting breast and colorectal cancer cases (Histopathological cancer registry, hospital Multidisciplinary Team Meetings, and cancer screening programmes), individual heterogeneity is suspected in cancer population due to age, gender, screening history or presence of metastases. Individual heterogeneity is hardly analysed as classical log-linear models usually pool it with between-list dependence. We applied Bayesian Model Averaging which can be applied with small sample without asymptotic assumption, contrary to the maximum likelihood estimate procedure. RESULTS: Cancer population estimates were based on the results of the M(h) model, with an averaged estimate of 803 cases of breast cancer and 521 cases of colorectal cancer. In the log-linear model, estimates were of 791 cases of breast cancer and 527 cases of colorectal cancer according to the retained models (729 and 481 histological cases, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We applied M(th) models and Bayesian population estimation to small sample of a cancer population. Advantage of M(th) models applied to cancer datasets, is the ability to explore individual factors associated with capture heterogeneity, as equal capture probability assumption is unlikely. M(th) models and Bayesian population estimation are well-suited for capture-recapture in a heterogeneous cancer population.;BMC Med Res Methodol. 2015 Apr 24.15:39. doi: 10.1186/s12874-015-0029-7.;Bailly L1,2, Daurès JP3,4, Dunais B5,6, Pradier C7,8.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Algorithms,Bayes Theorem*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology,Epidemiologic Methods,Female,Humans,Incidence,Linear Models*,Male,Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Population Surveillance/methods,Prevalence,Registries/statistics & numerical data*,Reproducibility of Results,Sample Size;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Automatic cervical cell segmentation and classification in Pap smears.;Abstract Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in females worldwide. The disease can be cured if the patient is diagnosed in the pre-cancerous lesion stage or earlier. A common physical examination technique widely used in the screening is Papanicolaou test or Pap test. In this research, a method for automatic cervical cancer cell segmentation and classification is proposed. A single-cell image is segmented into nucleus, cytoplasm, and background, using the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering technique. Four cell classes in the ERUDIT and LCH datasets, i.e., normal, low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are considered. The 2-class problem can be achieved by grouping the last 3 classes as one abnormal class. Whereas, the Herlev dataset consists of 7 cell classes, i.e., superficial squamous, intermediate squamous, columnar, mild dysplasia, moderate dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ. These 7 classes can also be grouped to form a 2-class problem. These 3 datasets were tested on 5 classifiers including Bayesian classifier, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). For the ERUDIT dataset, ANN with 5 nucleus-based features yielded the accuracies of 96.20% and 97.83% on the 4-class and 2-class problems, respectively. For the Herlev dataset, ANN with 9 cell-based features yielded the accuracies of 93.78% and 99.27% for the 7-class and 2-class problems, respectively. For the LCH dataset, ANN with 9 cell-based features yielded the accuracies of 95.00% and 97.00% for the 4-class and 2-class problems, respectively. The segmentation and classification performances of the proposed method were compared with that of the hard C-means clustering and watershed technique. The results show that the proposed automatic approach yields very good performance and is better than its counterparts.;Comput Methods Programs Biomed. 2014 Feb.113(2):539-56. doi: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2013.12.012.

0;Automated screening for quality control using PAPNET: a study of 638 negative Pap smears.;Abstract To determine if the PAPNET screening system can be used for quality control to lower false-negative rates for Pap smears 638 manually screened, negative Pap smears were subjected retrospectively to the PAPNET screening system. Twenty-nine of the smears came from 18 patients who subsequently had biopsyproven high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). The remaining 609 negative smears were arbitrarily selected as controls. One hundred twenty-eight (128) of the retrospectively reviewed smears (20%) were selected by PAPNET for microscopic referral because of potential abnormalities. Abnormalities were confirmed on 14 of these smears upon microscopic evaluation. Five of these 14 smears were from smears obtained from four of the 18 women with high-grade SIL. The incidence of manually screened false-negatives detected by PAPNET rescreening was 14/638 or 2.2% for the entire patient population in this study and 5/29 or 17.24% for the targeted patients known to have subsequently developed highgrade lesions. The 2.2% decrease in the false-negative rate in this experiment may be partly artificial as this study group was seeded with false-negative cases at high risk for containing missed abnormalities. The implementation of the PAPNET system for quality control may lower false-negative rates for Pap smears.;Diagn Cytopathol. 1996 Jun.14(4):316-20.;Keyhani-Rofagha S1, Palma T, O'Toole RV.;Automation,Biopsy,Diagnostic Errors,Female,Humans,Mass Screening/methods*,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Papanicolaou Test*,Quality Control,Reference Values,Retrospective Studies,Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/pathology*,Vaginal Smears/standards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Automated extraction of BI-RADS final assessment categories from radiology reports with natural language processing.;Abstract The objective of this study is to evaluate a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm that determines American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) final assessment categories from radiology reports. This HIPAA-compliant study was granted institutional review board approval with waiver of informed consent. This cross-sectional study involved 1,165 breast imaging reports in the electronic medical record (EMR) from a tertiary care academic breast imaging center from 2009. Reports included screening mammography, diagnostic mammography, breast ultrasound, combined diagnostic mammography and breast ultrasound, and breast magnetic resonance imaging studies. Over 220 reports were included from each study type. The recall (sensitivity) and precision (positive predictive value) of a NLP algorithm to collect BI-RADS final assessment categories stated in the report final text was evaluated against a manual human review standard reference. For all breast imaging reports, the NLP algorithm demonstrated a recall of 100.0 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 99.7, 100.0 %) and a precision of 96.6 % (95 % CI, 95.4, 97.5 %) for correct identification of BI-RADS final assessment categories. The NLP algorithm demonstrated high recall and precision for extraction of BI-RADS final assessment categories from the free text of breast imaging reports. NLP may provide an accurate, scalable data extraction mechanism from reports within EMRs to create databases to track breast imaging performance measures and facilitate optimal breast cancer population management strategies.;J Digit Imaging. 2013 Oct.26(5):989-94. doi: 10.1007/s10278-013-9616-5.;Sippo DA1, Warden GI, Andriole KP, Lacson R, Ikuta I, Birdwell RL, Khorasani R.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Cross-Sectional Studies,Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data,Female,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging/statistics & numerical data,Mammography/statistics & numerical data*,Natural Language Processing*,Radiology Information Systems/statistics & numerical data*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Ultrasonography, Mammary/statistics & numerical data*,T15 LM007092/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States,T15LM007092/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Atmospheric fine particulate matter and breast cancer mortality: a population-based cohort study.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has multiple adverse effects on human health. Global atmospheric levels of PM2.5 increased by 0.55 μg/m3/year (2.1%/year) from 1998 through 2012. There is evidence of a causal relationship between atmospheric PM2.5 and breast cancer (BC) incidence, but few studies have investigated BC mortality and atmospheric PM2.5. We investigated BC mortality in relation to atmospheric PM2.5 levels among patients living in Varese Province, northern Italy. METHODS: We selected female BC cases, archived in the local population-based cancer registry, diagnosed at age 50-69 years, between 2003 and 2009. The geographic coordinates of each woman's place of residence were identified, and individual PM2.5 exposures were assessed from satellite data. Grade, stage, age at diagnosis, period of diagnosis and participation in BC screening were potential confounders. Kaplan-Meir and Nelson-Aalen methods were used to test for mortality differences in relation to PM2.5 quartiles. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modelling estimated HRs and 95% CIs of BC death in relation to PM2.5 exposure. RESULTS: Of 2021 BC cases, 325 died during follow-up to 31 December 2013, 246 for BC. Risk of BC death was significantly higher for all three upper quartiles of PM2.5 exposure compared to the lowest, with HRs of death: 1.82 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.89), 1.73 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.67) and 1.72 (95% CI 1.08 to 2.75). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the risk of BC mortality increases with PM2.5 exposure. Although additional research is required to confirm these findings, they are further evidence that PM2.5 exposure is harmful and indicate an urgent need to improve global air quality.

0;Association between sleep and breast cancer incidence among postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative.;Abstract STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the duration of sleep, sleep quality, insomnia, or sleep disturbance was associated with incident breast cancer in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Women enrolled in one of the Clinical Trial (CT) arms or the Observational Study (OS) from the WHI conducted in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: This study included 110,011 women age 50 to 79 years with no history of cancer. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Typical sleep duration, sleep quality, and other self-reported sleep measures over the past 4 weeks were assessed during the screening visits for both the CT and OS participants. The presence of insomnia and level of sleep disturbance was calculated from an index of the WHI Insomnia Rating Scale. The outcome for this study was primary, invasive breast cancer. A total of 5,149 incident cases of breast cancer were identified in this study. No statistically significant associations were found between sleep duration, sleep quality, insomnia, or level of sleep disturbance with the risk of breast cancer after multivariable adjustment. A positive trend was observed for increasing sleeping duration with the risk of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer, but the association estimates for each sleep duration category were weak and nonsignificant.

0;Assessment of lead-time bias in estimates of relative survival for breast cancer.;Abstract Relative survival ratios (RSRs) can be useful for evaluating the impact of changes in cancer care on the prognosis of cancer patients or for comparing the prognosis for different subgroups of patients, but their use is problematic for cancer sites where screening has been introduced due to the potential of lead-time bias. Lead-time is survival time that is added to a patient's survival time because of an earlier diagnosis irrespective of a possibly postponed time of death. In the presence of screening it is difficult to disentangle how much of an observed improvement in survival is real and how much is due to lead-time bias. Even so, RSRs are often presented for breast cancer, a site where screening has led to early diagnosis, with the assumption that the lead-time bias is small. We describe a simulation-based framework for studying the lead-time bias due to mammography screening on RSRs of breast cancer based on a natural history model developed in a Swedish setting. We have performed simulations, using this framework, under different assumptions for screening sensitivity and breast cancer survival with the aim of estimating the lead-time bias. Screening every second year among ages 40-75 was introduced assuming that screening had no effect on survival, except for lead-time bias. Relative survival was estimated both with and without screening to enable quantification of the lead-time bias. Scenarios with low, moderate and high breast cancer survival, and low, moderate and high screening sensitivity were simulated, and the lead-time bias assessed in all scenarios.;Cancer Epidemiol. 2017 Feb.46:50-56. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2016.12.004.

0;Assessment of feasibility to use computer aided texture analysis based tool for parametric images of suspicious lesions in DCE-MR mammography.;Abstract Our aim was to analyze the feasibility of computer aided malignant tumor detection using the traditional texture analysis applied on two-compartment-based parameter pseudoimages of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MR) breast image data. A major contribution of this research will be the through-plane assessment capability. Texture analysis was performed on two-compartment-based pseudo images of DCE-MRI datasets of breast data of eight subjects. The resulting texture parameter pseudo images were inputted to a feedforward neural network classification system which uses the manual segmentations of a primary radiologist as a gold standard, and each voxel was assigned as malignant or nonmalignant. The classification results were compared with the lesions manually segmented by a second radiologist. Results show that the mean true positive fraction (TPF) and false positive fraction (FPF) performance of the classifier vs. primary radiologist is statistically as good as the mean TPF and FPF performance of the second radiologist vs. primary radiologist with a confidence interval of 95% using a one-sample t-test with α = 0.05. In the experiment implemented on all of the eight subjects, all malignant tumors marked by the primary radiologist were classified to be malignant by the computer classifier. Our results have shown that neural network classification using the textural parameters for automated screening of two-compartment-based parameter pseudo images of DCE-MRI as input data can be a supportive tool for the radiologists in the preassessment stage to show the possible cancerous regions and in the postassessment stage to review the segmentations especially in analyzing complex DCE-MRI cases.;Comput Math Methods Med. 2013.2013:872676. doi: 10.1155/2013/872676.

0;Assessing women's potential risk of developing breast cancer.;Abstract Available data show that women tend to overestimate their risk of developing breast cancer. Available models allow for the rapid identification of women who are at increased risk for breast cancer, along with a quantitative estimate of their probability of developing breast cancer over a period of years or by a certain age. Important risk factors include age. family history of breast cancer in first-degree (mother, sister, or daughter) or second-degree (aunt or grandmother) relatives. history of biopsy for benign breast disease, with or without atypical hyperplasia. nulliparity or first live birth after age 30. and menarche before age 12. Risk should be quantified routinely when women seek advice about breast cancer risk-management strategies. Counseling, with appropriate referrals when required, should always accompany specific recommendations for managing risk. Additional predictive models are needed for nonwhite women and for women not being screened regularly with mammography.;Oncology (Williston Park). 1996 Oct.10(10):1451-8, 1461. discussion 1462-3.;Vogel VG1.;Review,Biopsy,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/etiology*,Female,Humans,Mammography,Models, Statistical,Pedigree,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Assessing individual risk for prostate cancer.;Abstract PURPOSE: To construct a clinical nomogram instrument to estimate individual risk for having prostate cancer (PC) for patients undergoing prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening, using all risk factors known for PC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 3,108 men who underwent a prostate biopsy, including a subset of 408 volunteers with normal PSA levels. Factors including age, family history of PC (FHPC), ethnicity, urinary symptoms, PSA, free:total PSA ratio, and digital rectal examination (DRE) were incorporated in the model. A nomogram was constructed to assess risk for any and high-grade PC (Gleason score >or= 7). RESULTS: Of the 3,108 men, 1,304 (42.0%) were found to have PC. Among the 408 men with a normal PSA (< 4.0 ng/mL), 99 (24.3%) had PC. All risk factors were important predictors for PC by multivariate analysis (P, .01 to .0001). The area under the curve (AUC) for the nomogram in predicting cancer, which included age, ethnicity, FHPC, urinary symptoms, free:total PSA ratio, PSA, and DRE, was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.81) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.81) for high-grade cancer. This was significantly greater than the AUC that considered using the conventional screening method of PSA and DRE only (0.62. 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.66 for any cancer. 0.69. 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.73 for high-grade cancer). From receiver operating characteristic analysis, risk factors including age, ethnicity, FHPC, symptoms, and free:total PSA ratio contributed significantly more predictive information than PSA and DRE. CONCLUSION: In a PC screening program, it is important to consider age, family history of PC, ethnicity, urinary voiding symptoms, and free:total PSA ratio, in addition to PSA and DRE.;J Clin Oncol. 2007 Aug 20.25(24):3582-8.;Nam RK1, Toi A, Klotz LH, Trachtenberg J, Jewett MA, Appu S, Loblaw DA, Sugar L, Narod SA, Kattan MW.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Biopsy, Needle,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Nomograms*,Prostate/pathology,Prostate-Specific Antigen/analysis,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Prostatic Neoplasms/etiology,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Prostate-Specific Antigen;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;Assessing chronic disease progression using non-homogeneous exponential regression Markov models: an illustration using a selective breast cancer screening in Taiwan.;Abstract Previous research on estimation of the progression of chronic disease, from the normal preclinical screen-detectable phase (PCDP) to the final clinical phase, has usually assumed constant transition rates and has rarely addressed how relevant covariates affect multi-state transitions. The present study proposes two non-homogeneous models using the Weibull distribution and piecewise exponential model, together with covariate functions of the proportional hazard form, to tackle these problems. We illustrate the models by application to a selective breast cancer screening programme. The results of the Weibull model yield estimates of scale and shape parameters for annual preclinical incidence rate as 0.0000058 (SE=0.0000019) and 2.4755 (SE=0.1153), the latter being significantly higher than 1. Annual transition rate was estimated as 0.3153 (SE=0.1385). Relative risks for the effects of late age at first pregnancy (AP) and high body mass index (BMI) on preclinical incidence rate were 1.98 and 2.59, respectively. The corresponding figures on the transition from the PCDP to clinical phase were 1.56 and 1.99, respectively. Non-homogeneous Markov models proposed in this study can be easily applied to rates of progression of chronic disease with increasing or decreasing rates with time and to model the effect of relevant covariates on multi-state transition rates.;Stat Med. 2002 Nov 30.21(22):3369-82.;Hsieh HJ1, Chen TH, Chang SH.;Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Chronic Disease,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Mammography,Markov Chains,Mass Screening*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Risk Factors,Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Assessing Breast Cancer Risk among Iranian Women Using the Gail Model.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer risk assessment is a helpful method for estimating development of breast cancer at the population level. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, participants consisted of a group of 3,847 volunteers (mean ± SD age: 463 ± 7.59 years) in a convenience sample of women referred to health centers af liated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, Iran. The risk of breast cancer was estimated by applying the National Cancer Institute's online version of the Gail Risk Assessment Tool. RESULTS: Some 24.9% of women reported having one rst-degree female relative with breast cancer, with 8.05% of them having two or more rst-degree relatives with breast cancer. The mean five-year risk of breast cancer for all participants was 1.61±0.73%, and 9.36% of them had a five-year risk of breast cancer >1.66%. The mean lifetime risk of breast cancer was 11.7±3.91%. CONCLUSIONS: The Gail model is useful for assessing probability of breast cancer in Iranian women. Based on the their breast cancer risk, women may decide to accept further screening services.;Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2016.17(8):3759-62.;Khazaee-Pool M1, Majlessi F, Nedjat S, Montazeri A, Janani L, Pashaei T.;Adult,Breast/pathology,Breast Neoplasms/etiology*,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Iran,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Risk Assessment/methods,Risk Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Artefact-free trends in breast cancer incidence over two decades in a whole French Département.;Abstract The objective was to discuss the evolution of the real incidence of breast cancer. Observed incidence as calculated by cancer registries differs from the real incidence because of the artifacts brought by diagnostic procedures and case collection. Age-period-cohort models were applied to nearly 11,200 incident breast cancers collected by the Cancer Registry of Isère from 1983 to 2002 in women aged 30-84. We took into account prior knowledge and assumptions concerning the evolution of real incidence, diagnostic procedures, and collection of cases. In the age group 30-49, no real incidence increase was seen if we assume that diagnostic procedures and collection of cases were not impaired. In women aged 50-69, an increase of real incidence and intensive screening could explain the increase of observed incidence but exact quantifications are difficult. At most, the increase due to screening would reach 50%. In women aged 70-84, no real incidence increase was suspected if we assume that changes in clinical practices and screening led to more breast cancer cases collected.;Breast. 2008 Dec.17(6):580-6. doi: 10.1016/j.breast.2008.07.001.

0;Are depressive symptoms associated with cancer screening and cancer stage at diagnosis among postmenopausal women? The Women's Health Initiative observational cohort.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Women with depressive symptoms may use preventive services less frequently and experience poorer health outcomes. We investigated the association of depressive symptoms with breast and colorectal cancer screening rates and stage of cancer among a cohort of postmenopausal women. METHODS: In The Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, 93,676 women were followed on average for 7.6 years. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and at 3 years using the 6-item scale from the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). We calculated a cancer screening rate expressed as a proportion of the years that women were current with recommended cancer screening over the number of follow-up visits in the study. Breast and colorectal cancers were staged based on Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) classification. RESULTS: At baseline, 15.8% (12,621) women were positive for depressive symptoms, and 6.9% (4,777) were positive at both baseline screening and at 3 years. The overall average screening rate was 71% for breast cancer and 53% for colorectal cancer. The breast cancer screening rate was 1.5% (CI 0.9%-2.0%) lower among women who reported depressive symptoms at baseline than among those who did not. Depressive symptoms were not a predictor for colorectal cancer screening. Stage of breast and colorectal cancer was not found to be associated with depressive symptoms after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Among a healthy and self-motivated cohort of women, self-reported depressive symptoms were associated with lower rates of screening mammography but not with colorectal cancer screening.;J Womens Health (Larchmt). 2008 Oct.17(8):1353-61. doi: 10.1089/jwh.2007.0544.;Aggarwal A1, Freund K, Sato A, Adams-Campbell LL, Lopez AM, Lessin LS, Ockene J, Wallace RB, Williams CD, Bonds DE.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/psychology,Cohort Studies,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/psychology,Depressive Disorder/epidemiology*,Endoscopy,Feces,Female,Humans,Linear Models,Mammography/psychology,Mammography/utilization,Mass Screening/psychology,Mass Screening/utilization*,Middle Aged,Neoplasm Staging,Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology*,Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data*,Postmenopause,Psychiatric Status Rating Scales,Risk Factors,United States/epidemiology,Women's Health;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Application of a stochastic modeling to assess the evolution of tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.;Abstract In this manuscript we apply stochastic modeling to investigate the risk of reactivation of latent mycobacterial infections in patients undergoing treatment with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. First, we review the perspective proposed by one of the authors in a previous work and which consists in predicting the occurrence of reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection or newly acquired tuberculosis during treatment. this is based on variational procedures on a simple set of parameters (e.g. rate of reactivation of a latent infection). Then, we develop a full analytical study of this approach through a Markov chain analysis and we find an exact solution for the temporal evolution of the number of cases of tuberculosis infection (re)activation. The analytical solution is compared with Monte Carlo simulations and with experimental data, showing overall excellent agreement. The generality of this theoretical framework allows to investigate also the case of non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections. in particular, we show that reactivation in that context plays a minor role. This may suggest that, while the screening for tuberculous is necessary prior to initiating biologics, when considering non-tuberculous mycobacteria only a watchful monitoring during the treatment is recommended. The framework outlined in this paper is quite general and could be extremely promising in further researches on drug-related adverse events.;PLoS One. 2013.8(1):e55017. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0055017.

0;Anxiety After Diagnosis Predicts Lung Cancer-Specific and Overall Survival in Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Population-Based Cohort Study.;Abstract CONTEXT: The question as to whether anxiety and depression are related to mortality in patients with lung cancer is inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: Therefore, the present study is examining associations of anxiety and depression in a large representative sample of patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: Patients (n = 684) were routinely assessed for anxiety and depression with the PsychoSocial Screen for Cancer questionnaire after diagnosis of lung cancer and before treatment initiation between 2004 and 2010. Survival data were retrieved in May 2012. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses had been used as statistical procedures allowing adjustment for demographic, biomedical, and treatment variables. RESULTS: In analyses controlling for demographic, biomedical, and treatment prognosticators, anxiety but not depression was associated with increased lung cancer-specific (hazard ratio 1.04. 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.07. P = 0.035) and all-cause (hazard ratio 1.04. 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.07. P = 0.005) mortality. Secondary analyses revealed a confounder effect of performance status on the association between depression and mortality, such that the removal of performance status identified a significant relationship of depression on lung cancer-specific and all-cause mortality. CONCLUSION: In a large population-based sample of patients with non-small cell lung cancer analyses demonstrated associations of anxiety with mortality, adding to the evidence that psychosocial factors might play a role in disease progression in this patient group. Because emotional distress is associated with continued smoking and lack of success of smoking cessation attempts, psychological interventions potentially could influence length of survival in lung cancer patients.

0;Annual Combined Mammography and Tomosynthesis Screening: Is It Really Cost-Effective?;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Examining the comparative effectiveness of adding tomosynthesis to mammography screening in the United States would help key stakeholders, including physicians and policy makers, guide shared decision-making and recommendations for routine breast cancer screening. CONCLUSION: More robust data from U.S.-based longitudinal observational studies, clinical trials, or both are needed, along with the use of validated microsimulation models, before clinical- and cost-effectiveness of tomosynthesis screening versus mammography screening can be fully characterized.;AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2016 Nov.207(5):1156-1158.

0;An investigation into the psychometric properties of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale in patients with breast cancer.;Abstract BACKGROUND: To determine the psychometric properties of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in patients with breast cancer and determine the suitability of the instrument for use with this clinical group. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used. The study used a pooled data set from three breast cancer clinical groups. The dependent variables were HADS anxiety and depression sub-scale scores. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on the HADS to determine its psychometric properties in 110 patients with breast cancer. Seven models were tested to determine model fit to the data. RESULTS: Both factor analysis methods indicated that three-factor models provided a better fit to the data compared to two-factor (anxiety and depression) models for breast cancer patients. Clark and Watson's three factor tripartite and three factor hierarchical models provided the best fit. CONCLUSION: The underlying factor structure of the HADS in breast cancer patients comprises three distinct, but correlated factors, negative affectivity, autonomic anxiety and anhedonic depression. The clinical utility of the HADS in screening for anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients may be enhanced by using a modified scoring procedure based on a three-factor model of psychological distress. This proposed alternate scoring method involving regressing autonomic anxiety and anhedonic depression factors onto the third factor (negative affectivity) requires further investigation in order to establish its efficacy.;Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2005 Jul 14.3:41.;Rodgers J1, Martin CR, Morse RC, Kendell K, Verrill M.;Validation Studies,Adult,Anxiety/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Breast Neoplasms/psychology*,Cross-Sectional Studies,Depression/diagnosis*,Factor Analysis, Statistical,Female,Hospitalization,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Neoplasm Staging,Psychometrics/instrumentation*,Quality of Life/psychology*,Sickness Impact Profile*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;An Innovative Approach: Using Simulation to Teach Primary Care Gynecologic Procedures.;Abstract INTRODUCTION: In response to the growing body of evidence that simulation is a satisfactory way to instruct procedural skills, we developed an innovative model to teach common gynecologic procedures such as cervical cancer screening, cervical polyp removal, intrauterine device removal, and endometrial biopsy. The objectives of this study were to describe the construction of the model and to assess participants' satisfaction and confidence in applying the learning objectives to their clinical practice. METHODS: The researchers created the model with reusable and readily available materials. During a hands-on skills workshop, practicing clinicians performed simulated cervical cancer screening, endocervical polyp removal, intrauterine device removal, and an endometrial biopsy on a low-fidelity gynecologic model. Using convenience sampling, each participant completed a survey designed to measure satisfaction with the workshop and self-confidence in their newly acquired skills. RESULTS: All (N = 30,100%) of the participants agreed at the agree or strongly agree level that the gynecologic skills workshop using lecture and a hands-on model was a satisfying and self-confidence-building experience. CONCLUSIONS: An easily reproducible and reusable gynecologic procedure simulator was highly rated as a means of teaching common primary care gynecologic procedures. The simulated model provided an opportunity for hands-on skills learning for clinicians who wish to expand their gynecologic procedure skill set.;Simul Healthc. 2017 Aug.12(4):268-273. doi: 10.1097/SIH.0000000000000213.;Hellier SD1, Ramponi DR, Wrynn A, Garofalo S.;Adult,Clinical Competence,Education, Medical, Continuing,Female,Gynecologic Surgical Procedures/education*,Humans,Internship and Residency,Male,Middle Aged,Primary Health Care*,Simulation Training*,Young Adult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;An Improved CAD System for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Based on Generalized Pseudo-Zernike Moment and Ada-DEWNN Classifier.;Abstract In this paper, a novel framework of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system has been presented for the classification of benign/malignant breast tissues. The properties of the generalized pseudo-Zernike moments (GPZM) and pseudo-Zernike moments (PZM) are utilized as suitable texture descriptors of the suspicious region in the mammogram. An improved classifier- adaptive differential evolution wavelet neural network (Ada-DEWNN) is proposed to improve the classification accuracy of the CAD system. The efficiency of the proposed system is tested on mammograms from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (mini-MIAS) database using the leave-one-out cross validation as well as on mammograms from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) database using 10-fold cross validation. The proposed method on MIAS-database attains a fair accuracy of 0.8938 and AUC of 0.935 (95 % CI = 0.8213-0.9831). The proposed method is also tested for in-plane rotation and found to be highly rotation invariant. In addition, the proposed classifier is tested and compared with some well-known existing methods using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using DDSM- database. It is concluded the proposed classifier has better area under the curve (AUC) (0.9289) and highly précised with 95 % CI, 0.8216 to 0.9834 and 0.0384 standard error.;J Med Syst. 2016 Apr.40(4):105. doi: 10.1007/s10916-016-0454-0.

0;An EM algorithm for nonparametric estimation of the cumulative incidence function from repeated imperfect test results.;Abstract In screening and surveillance studies, event times are interval censored. Besides, screening tests are imperfect so that the interval at which an event takes place may be uncertain. We describe an expectation-maximization algorithm to find the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the cumulative incidence function of an event based on screening test data. Our algorithm has a closed-form solution for the combined expectation and maximization step and is computationally undemanding. A simulation study indicated that the bias of the estimator tends to zero for large sample size, and its mean squared error is in general lower than the mean squared error of the estimator that assumes the screening test is perfect. We apply the algorithm to follow-up data from women treated for cervical precancer. Copyright � 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;Stat Med. 2017 Sep 20.36(21):3412-3421. doi: 10.1002/sim.7373.

1;An economic model for comparing alternative policies for cervical cytologic smear screening.;Abstract In this paper a mathematical model is developed to determine the probability that a truly negative cervical cytologic smear will be correctly identified by a system of screening policies that uses one or more cytotechnologists to independently and sequentially prescreen such smears for the detection of cervical cancer. This is an extension of previous work that modeled the probability of detecting a truly positive smear under the same set of policies. In this system any positive reading by a cytotechnologist causes a slide to be rescreened by a pathologist, and if all cytotechnologists declare a slide to be negative, the slide is placed in a pool for random selection of slides to be rescreened by the pathologist. The policy of single screening by a cytotechnologist, with subsequent 10% rescreening of the negative slides, as suggested by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, is thus embedded in the policies that are modeled. In addition, a cost model is developed that takes into account the cost of screening a slide by a cytotechnologist, of rescreening a slide by a pathologist, of a false-positive reading and of a false-negative reading. This cost model can be used to determine which policy is optimal for the parameters that pertain to a specific situation. Examples are presented to illustrate the use of the cost model. The results of a computer simulation model are also presented to validate the mathematical results and to display the variability of total cost.;Acta Cytol. 1995 Mar-Apr.39(2):232-8.;Kaminsky FC1, Burke RJ, Haberle KR, Mullins DL.;Costs and Cost Analysis,False Negative Reactions,False Positive Reactions,Female,Humans,Models, Economic*,Sensitivity and Specificity,United States,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Vaginal Smears/standards*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;An assessment of existing models for individualized breast cancer risk estimation in a screening program in Spain.;Abstract BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the calibration and discriminatory power of three predictive models of breast cancer risk. METHODS: We included 13,760 women who were first-time participants in the Sabadell-Cerdanyola Breast Cancer Screening Program, in Catalonia, Spain. Projections of risk were obtained at three and five years for invasive cancer using the Gail, Chen and Barlow models. Incidence and mortality data were obtained from the Catalan registries. The calibration and discrimination of the models were assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow C statistic, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Harrell's C statistic. RESULTS: The Gail and Chen models showed good calibration while the Barlow model overestimated the number of cases: the ratio between estimated and observed values at 5 years ranged from 0.86 to 1.55 for the first two models and from 1.82 to 3.44 for the Barlow model. The 5-year projection for the Chen and Barlow models had the highest discrimination, with an AUC around 0.58. The Harrell's C statistic showed very similar values in the 5-year projection for each of the models. Although they passed the calibration test, the Gail and Chen models overestimated the number of cases in some breast density categories. CONCLUSIONS: These models cannot be used as a measure of individual risk in early detection programs to customize screening strategies. The inclusion of longitudinal measures of breast density or other risk factors in joint models of survival and longitudinal data may be a step towards personalized early detection of BC.;BMC Cancer. 2013 Dec 10.13:587. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-587.;Arrospide A, Forné C, Rué M, Torà N, Mar J, Baré M1.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Incidence,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Reproducibility of Results,Risk*,Spain/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;An approach for generating fuzzy rules from decision trees.;Abstract Identifying high-risk breast cancer patients is vital both for clinicians and for patients. Some variables for identifying these patients such as tumor size are good candidates for fuzzification. In this study, Decision Tree Induction (DTI) has been applied to 3949 female breast cancer patients and crisp If-Then rules has been acquired from the resulting tree. After assigning membership functions for each variable in the crisp rules, they were converted into fuzzy rules and a mathematical model was constructed. One hundred randomly selected cases were examined by this model and compared with crisp rules predictions. The outcomes were examined by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). No significant difference was noticed between these two approaches for prediction of recurrence of breast cancer. By soft discretization of variables according to resulting rules from DTI, a predictive model, which is both more robust to noise and more comprehensible for clinicians, can be built.;Stud Health Technol Inform. 2006.124:581-6.;Razavi AR1, Nyström M, Stachowicz MS, Gill H, Ahlfeldt H, Shahsavar N.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms,Decision Trees*,Female,Fuzzy Logic*,Humans,Mass Screening*,Models, Statistical;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;An alternative cost effectiveness analysis of ThinPrep in the Australian setting.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and economic impacts of the use of liquid based cytology (LBC) in the Australian average risk population from the perspective of the public health care budget. BACKGROUND: Concerns over the evaluation of medical technologies in Australia, which are assessed by the Medicare Services Advisory Committee (MSAC), have been raised recently. We report on the evaluation of LBC, which although being widely adopted in other parts of the world, has, despite substantial uptake in the private sector in Australia, been rejected for public funding by MSAC. METHODS: We used the health economic model developed by MSAC, but populated the model with the best available international data, sourced from a published review article. The economic model considered the clinical benefits and the costs arising from a biennial cervical screening programme. Net costs divided by life years saved is the cost per life year saved and this is reported as the incremental cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Populating the MSAC model with data on test performance showed that one type of LBC (ThinPrep) 'dominates' the conventional Pap smear in the screening of average risk women in the Australian setting. CONCLUSION: The health economic model created by MSAC predicts that ThinPrep dominates the conventional Pap as a screening test for cervical cancer. An additional 2240 high-grade lesions could be detected, resulting in 480 life years gained and delivering an expected saving to the health care system of $5,536,000 per annum if liquid based cytology replaced the conventional Pap.;Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol. 2005 Aug.45(4):289-94.;Neville AM1, Quinn MA.;Australia,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Care Costs*,Humans,Models, Economic,Monte Carlo Method,National Health Programs*,Papanicolaou Test*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/therapy,Vaginal Smears/economics*,Vaginal Smears/methods*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Algorithms, nomograms and the detection of indolent prostate cancer.;Abstract PURPOSE: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. However, only about 12% of the men diagnosed with prostate cancer will die of their disease. RESULT: The serum PSA test can detect prostate cancers early, but using a PSA based cut-off indication for prostate biopsy results in unnecessary testing in app. 75-80% of the men and perhaps even more important the serum PSA test cannot tell how aggressive the cancer is. To decrease unnecessary testing different test results are often combined, converted into a probability and displayed graphically. There are more than 40 of these so called nomograms in the case of prostate cancer. These nomograms can be divided into two categories, namely those that predict biopsy outcome using results from serum determination(s) or non-invasive tests such as the DRE and TRUS. The second category represents those nomograms that predict tumor characteristics and prognosis using information coming from pathology review. CONCLUSION: The ultimate nomogram able to predict tumor characteristics and progression purely based on non-invasive testing will for a large part put an end to the negative side effects and uncertainties that coincide with the early detection of prostate cancer, if it will ever be made.;World J Urol. 2008 Oct.26(5):423-9. doi: 10.1007/s00345-008-0278-8.

0;Age-specific spatio-temporal patterns of female breast cancer mortality in Spain (1975-2005).;Abstract PURPOSE: In recent decades, a decline in breast cancer mortality has been observed across Europe, and also in Spain. Our objective is to assess the spatio-temporal pattern during the period 1975-2005 by specific age groups (<45, 45-64, ≥65) in the Spanish provinces. METHODS: For each age group, a spatio-temporal P-spline model with a B-spline basis is used to smooth the mortality risks. Smoothing is carried out in three dimensions: longitude, latitude, and time, allowing for a different time evolution of both spatial components. The age-specific decline is calculated as the maximum of the estimated curve in each province. A confidence band for each curve is also provided. RESULTS: For the first age group (<45), the decline in the different provinces is observed between 1986 and 1991. For women aged between 45 to 64 years, the change occurs between 1990 and 1993. For the third age group (≥65), change points range from 1992 to 2000, unlike Malaga and Cadiz where the change has not been observed in the studied period. Northern and some Mediterranean provinces are the areas with higher mortality risks for all the age groups. CONCLUSIONS: A different behavior for breast cancer mortality risks is observed for different provinces among the age specific groups. The decline of mortality is delayed for the oldest age group. Province differences in the implementation of screening programs could explain some of the observed differences. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

0;Age-period-cohort analysis of cervical cancer incidence in Hong Kong from 1972 to 2001 using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To examine the secular effects of opportunistic screening for cervical cancer in a rich, developed community where most other such populations have long adopted organised screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The analysis was based on 15 140 cases of invasive cervical cancer from 1972 to 2001. The effects of chronological age, time period, and birth cohort were decomposed using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. RESULTS: The overall age adjusted incidence decreased from 24.9 in 1972-74 to 9.5 per 100,000 in 1999-2001, in a log-linear fashion, yielding an average annual reduction of 4.0% (p<0.001) during the 30 year period. There were two second order and thus identifiable changes: (1) around the mid-1920s cohort curve representing an age-period interaction masquerading as a cohort change that denotes the first availability of Pap testing during the 1960s concentrated among women in their 40s. (2) a hook around the calendar years 1982-83 when cervical cytology became a standard screening test for pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Hong Kong's cervical cancer rates have declined since Pap tests first became available in the 1960s, most probably because of increasing population coverage over time and in successive generations in a haphazard fashion and punctuated by the systematic introduction of routine cytology as part of antenatal care in the 1980s.;J Epidemiol Community Health. 2006 Aug.60(8):712-20.;Leung GM1, Woo PP, McGhee SM, Cheung AN, Fan S, Mang O, Thach TQ, Ngan HY.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Bayes Theorem,Cohort Studies,Female,Hong Kong/epidemiology,Humans,Incidence,Likelihood Functions,Longitudinal Studies,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Time Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Adopting helical CT screening for lung cancer: potential health consequences during a 15-year period.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Simulation modeling can synthesize data from single-arm studies of lung cancer screening and tumor registries to investigate computed tomography (CT) screening. This study estimated changes in lung cancer outcomes through 2005, had chest CT screening been introduced in 1990. METHODS: Hypothetical individuals with smoking histories representative of 6 US cohorts (white males and females aged 50, 60, and 70 years in 1990) were simulated in the Lung Cancer Policy Model, a comprehensive patient-level simulation model of lung cancer development, screening, and treatment. A no screening scenario corresponded to observed outcomes. We simulated 3 screening scenarios in current or former smokers with > or =20 pack-years as follows: 1-time screen in 1990. and annual, and twice-annually screenings beginning in 1990 and ending in 2005. Main outcomes were days of life between 1990 and 2005 and life expectancy in 1990 (estimated by simulating life histories past 2005). RESULTS: All screening scenarios yielded reductions (compared with no screening) in lung cancer-specific mortality by 2005, with larger reductions predicted for more frequent screening. Compared with no screening, annual screening of ever-smokers with at least 20 pack-years of cigarette exposure provided ever-smokers with an additional 11 to 33 days of life by 2005, or an additional 3-10 weeks of (undiscounted) life expectancy. In sensitivity analyses, the largest effects on gains from annual screening were due to reductions in screening adherence and increased smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of CT screening, had it been available in 1990, might have resulted in a modest gain in life expectancy.;Cancer. 2008 Dec 15.113(12):3440-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23962.;McMahon PM1, Kong CY, Weinstein MC, Tramontano AC, Cipriano LE, Johnson BE, Weeks JC, Gazelle GS.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Aged,Computer Simulation*,Female,Humans,Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Lung Neoplasms/mortality,Male,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Sensitivity and Specificity,Time Factors,Tomography, Spiral Computed*,R01 CA097337-03S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,K99 CA126147-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,K99 CA126147/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA097337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R00 CA126147/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R01 CA97337/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Active smoking and risk of breast cancer in a Danish nurse cohort study.;Abstract BACKGROUND: No scientific consensus has been reached on whether active tobacco smoking causes breast cancer. We examine the association between active smoking and breast cancer risk in Denmark, which has some of the highest smoking and breast cancer rates in women worldwide. METHODS: We used the data from a nationwide Danish Nurse Cohort on 21,867 female nurses (age > 44 years) who at recruitment in 1993 or 1999 reported information on smoking status, onset, duration, and intensity, as well as breast cancer risk factors. We obtained data on incidence of breast cancer from Danish Cancer Registry until 2013, and used Cox regression models to analyze the association between smoking and breast cancer. RESULTS: Of 21,831 women (mean age 53.2 years) 1162 developed breast cancer during 15.7 years of follow-up. 33.7% of nurses were current and 30.0% former smokers at cohort baseline. Compared to never smokers, we found increased risk of breast cancer of 18% in ever (hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval: 1.18. 1.04-1.34) and 27% in current (1.27. 1.11-1.46) smokers. We detected a dose-response relationship with smoking intensity with the highest breast cancer risk in women smoking >15 g/day (1.31. 1.11-1.56) or >20 pack-years (1.32. 1.12-1.55). Parous women who smoked heavily (>10 pack-years) before first childbirth had the highest risk of breast cancer (1.58. 1.20-2.10). Association between smoking and breast cancer was not modified by menopausal status, obesity, alcohol or hormone therapy use, and seemed to be limited to the estrogen receptor positive breast cancer subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Active smoking increases risk of breast cancer, with smoking before first birth being the most relevant exposure window.;BMC Cancer. 2017 Aug 22.17(1):556. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3546-4.;Andersen ZJ1, Jørgensen JT2, Grøn R2, Brauner EV3,4, Lynge E2.;Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Breast Neoplasms/etiology*,Cohort Studies,Denmark/epidemiology,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Nurses*,Proportional Hazards Models,Public Health Surveillance,Registries,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Smoking/adverse effects*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;Active cigarette smoking and risk of breast cancer.;Abstract Although epidemiological evidence on the role of active cigarette smoking in breast cancer risk has been inconsistent, recent literature supports a modest association between smoking and breast cancer. This association is particularly observed in women who smoke for a long duration, or who smoke for a long time prior to their first pregnancy. Here, we provide updated results on cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk in the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (NBSS). The NBSS is a large cohort of 89,835 women, aged 40-59, who were followed for a mean of 22.1 years, resulting in the ascertainment of 6,549 incident cases of breast cancer. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of cigarette smoking variables with breast cancer risk. We found breast cancer to be associated with duration (40 years vs. 0: HR = 1.57. 95%CI = 1.29-1.92), intensity (40 cigarettes per day vs. 0: HR = 1.21. 95%CI = 1.04-1.40), cumulative exposure (40 pack-years vs. 0: HR = 1.19. 95%CI = 1.06-1.13) and latency (40 years since initiation vs. 0: HR = 1.19. 95%CI = 1.10-1.53) of cigarette smoking. Number of years smoked prior to first full-term pregnancy was associated with higher risk of breast cancer than comparative years smoked post-pregnancy (among parous women, 5 years pre pregnancy vs. 0: HR = 1.18. 95%CI = 1.10-1.26). These results strongly support a role for cigarette smoking in breast cancer etiology and emphasize the importance of timing of this exposure.;Int J Cancer. 2015 May 1.136(9):2204-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29266.

0;A use of a neural network to evaluate contrast enhancement curves in breast magnetic resonance images.;Abstract For the diagnosis of breast cancer using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), one of the most important parameters is the analysis of contrast enhancement. A three-dimensional MR sequence is applied before and five times after bolus injection of paramagnetic contrast medium (Gd-DTPA). The dynamics of absorption are described by a time/intensity enhancement curve, which reports the mean intensity of the MR signal in a small region of interest (ROI) for about 8 minutes after contrast injection. The aim of our study was to use an artificial neural network to automatically classify the enhancement curves as benign or malignant. We used a classic feed-forward back-propagation neural network, with three layers: five input nodes, two hidden nodes, and one output node. The network has been trained with 26 pathologic curves (10 invasive carcinoma [K], two carcinoma-in-situ [DCIS], and 14 benign lesion [B]). The trained network has been tested with 58 curves (36 K, one DCIS, 21 B). The network was able to correctly identify the test curves with a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 90%. For comparison, the same set of curves was analyzed separately by two radiologists (a breast MR expert and a resident radiologist). The first correctly interpreted the curves with a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 90%, while the second scored 59% for sensitivity and 90% for specificity. These results demonstrate that a trained neural network recognizes the pathologic curves at least as well as an expert radiologist. This algorithm can help the radiologist attain rapid and affordable screening of a large number of ROIs. A complete automatic computer-aided diagnosis support system should find a number of potentially interesting ROIs and automatically analyze the enhancement curves for each ROI by neural networks, reporting to the radiologist only the potentially pathologic ROIs for a more accurate, manual, repeated evaluation.;J Digit Imaging. 2001 Jun.14(2 Suppl 1):58-9.;Vergnaghi D1, Monti A, Setti E, Musumeci R.;Breast/pathology*,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Contrast Media,Female,Gadolinium DTPA,Humans,Magnetic Resonance Imaging*,Neural Networks (Computer)*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Contrast Media,Gadolinium DTPA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;A two-stage Bayesian method for estimating accuracy and disease prevalence for two dependent dichotomous screening tests when the status of individuals who are negative on both tests is unverified.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Estimating the disease prevalence and test accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) for two dependent screening tests when the status of individuals who are negative on both tests is unverified represents a considerable challenge, as the disease rates for individuals negative on both tests are not identifiable without additional assumptions. METHODS: This article presents a unified framework for handling this non-identifiability problem using two-step hierarchical informative prior on the sensitivities by two-stage Bayesian modeling with the characterized by joint testing strategies based on the inherent attribute of screening/diagnostic tests. We assign a diffuse and less risky two-step hierarchical informative uniform prior to the sensitivities while assigning a uniform (0,1) prior distribution to the specificities and prevalence. Strategies for model evaluation, general global evaluations, and individual cell checking are presented. Simulations are conducted under various scenarios to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Applications to real data are also presented to illustrate the potential impact and benefit of the proposed method. RESULTS: Our results indicate that when the priors of sensitivities are assigned as appropriate two-step hierarchical informative priors, or even in the absence of the priors for the specificities and prevalence, the parameters involved in this study can still be estimated well. The advantages and limitations of this method in solving such problems are discussed and compared with other two-stage methods. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a two-stage Bayesian method for two dependent dichotomous screening tests with unverified individuals who are negative on both tests, and addressed the ad hoc model evaluation and checking procedures. The method can be understood easily and used conveniently by non-statisticians.;BMC Med Res Methodol. 2014 Sep 23.14:110. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-14-110.;Liu J, Chen F1, Yu H, Zeng P, Liu L.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Bayes Theorem*,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis,Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Computer Simulation,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/methods,Mass Screening/statistics & numerical data*,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical,Occult Blood,Prevalence,Sensitivity and Specificity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;A study of Pap test history and histologically determined cervical cancer in NSW women, 1997-2003.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk of a histological diagnosis of cervical cancer following a given Pap test result and for a given history of Pap test results in a screened population across the full spectrum of possible cytological results. METHODS: All the Pap screening results held on the New South Wales Pap Test Register for 1997-2003 (five million tests for 1.87 million women) were analysed using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the odds of having a histologically determined cervical cancer for a given Pap test result and test result history. The hazard ratios of having cervical cancer in relation to Pap test result histories were estimated: (i) in regard only to the last Pap test result adjusting for age, frequency of Pap testing and proportion of high grade (>or=cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 [CIN2]) abnormalities found in a woman's total recorded test result history. and (ii) with regard to the last Pap test result against the highest grade of cytological abnormality found prior to the last Pap test result. The hazard ratios are for a cancer diagnosis occurring before the next Pap test and were adjusted for age, quintile of socioeconomic status of residence, frequency of past Pap testing and proportion of high-grade abnormalities detected in each woman's prior Pap test history. The adjusted hazard ratios were then applied to the tabulated proportions of referent women with negative cytology in each broad age group, and for all women, to estimate the '1 in n' odds of being diagnosed histologically with cervical cancer for a given last Pap test result, and by a given last Pap test result for various prior Pap test result histories. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, socioeconomic status, frequency of previous Pap testing and proportion of past high-grade screen-detected abnormalities, the adjusted hazard ratio of having a subsequent cervical cancer diagnosis for women with a negative Pap test result was 1 in 5,546, compared with 1 in 833 for a low-grade epithelial abnormality (atypia, CIN1), 1 in 56 for a high-grade epithelial abnormality and 1 in seven for a cytological prediction of cervical cancer. These odds estimates were significantly modified by age and by the highest Pap test result prior to the most recent Pap test result: the higher the age and, less consistently, the higher the previous highest Pap test result for a given last Pap test result, the shorter the odds of having a subsequent histological diagnosis of cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here will enable clinicians to inform their patients of their chances of being diagnosed with cervical cancer for a given Pap test result, and for some combinations of the last Pap test result and highest recorded prior Pap test result.;J Med Screen. 2005.12(4):190-6.;Morrell S1, Taylor R, Wain G.;Adolescent,Adult,Cohort Studies,Female,Humans,Medical Records, Problem-Oriented,Middle Aged,New South Wales/epidemiology,Proportional Hazards Models,Prospective Studies,Regression Analysis,Retrospective Studies,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology*,Vaginal Smears/statistics & numerical data*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;A stochastic model for predicting the mortality of breast cancer.;Abstract Consider a cohort of women, identified by year of birth, some of whom will eventually be diagnosed with breast cancer. A stochastic model is developed for predicting the U.S. breast cancer mortality that depends on advances in therapy and dissemination of mammographic screening. The predicted mortality can be compared with the same cohort having usual care with no screening program and absence of modern therapy, or a cohort in which only a proportion participate in a screening program and have modern therapy. The model envisions that a woman may be in four health states: i.e., 1) no disease or breast cancer that cannot be diagnosed (S0), 2) preclinical state (Sp), 3) clinical state (Sc), and 4) disease-specific death (Sd). The preclinical disease refers to breast cancer that is asymptomatic but that may be diagnosed with a special exam. The clinical state refers to symptomatic disease diagnosed under usual care. One of the basic assumptions of the model is that the disease is progressive. i.e., the transitions for the first three states are S0-->Sp-->Sc. The other basic assumption is that any reduction in mortality associated with earlier diagnosis is due to a stage shift in diagnosis. i.e., early diagnosis results in a larger proportion of earlier stage patients. The model is used to predict changes in female breast cancer mortality in the U.S. women for 1975-2000. The model is general and may predict mortality for other chronic diseases that satisfy the two basic assumptions.;J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2006.(36):79-86.;Lee S1, Zelen M.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/mortality*,Cohort Studies,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Mammography/statistics & numerical data,Middle Aged,Models, Statistical*,Predictive Value of Tests,Sensitivity and Specificity,Stochastic Processes,Survival Rate,United States/epidemiology,CA88270/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;A simulation model for evaluating the medical and economic outcomes of screening strategies for colorectal cancer.;Abstract Mathematical models have been shown to be useful in predicting the cost-effectiveness of cancer screening programmes. We designed a computer macro-simulation model aimed at predicting the cost-effectiveness of alternative colorectal cancer screening strategies. This model was built to determine the cost-effectiveness of a biennial screening programme using the Hemoccult test in Burgundy (France). It was validated with data from the Danish randomized study. Estimates of our model showed an extremely close concordance with observed results in the Danish study. The observed mortality reduction was 18.0% and the estimated mortality reduction was 18.4%. Preliminary data from the Burgundy study predict a 14.6% colorectal cancer mortality reduction after 10 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed with different assumptions regarding the participation rates and the lead-time. This model can serve to assess the cost-effectiveness of a variety of screening modalities.;Eur J Cancer Prev. 2003 Feb.12(1):77-84.;Lejeune C1, Arveux P, Dancourt V, Fagnani F, Bonithon-Kopp C, Faivre J.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Aged,Cohort Studies,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics*,Computer Simulation,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Denmark,Female,Forecasting,France,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical*,Occult Blood*,Predictive Value of Tests;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;A simulation model approach to analysis of the business case for eliminating health care disparities.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Purchasers can play an important role in eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care. A need exists to develop a compelling business case from the employer perspective to put, and keep, the issue of racial/ethnic disparities in health care on the quality improvement agenda for health plans and providers. METHODS: To illustrate a method for calculating an employer business case for disparity reduction and to compare the business case in two clinical areas, we conducted analyses of the direct (medical care costs paid by employers) and indirect (absenteeism, productivity) effects of eliminating known racial/ethnic disparities in mammography screening and appropriate medication use for patients with asthma. We used Markov simulation models to estimate the consequences, for defined populations of African-American employees or health plan members, of a 10% increase in HEDIS mammography rates or a 10% increase in appropriate medication use among either adults or children/adolescents with asthma. RESULTS: The savings per employed African-American woman aged 50-65 associated with a 10% increase in HEDIS mammography rate, from direct medical expenses and indirect costs (absenteeism, productivity) combined, was $50. The findings for asthma were more favorable from an employer point of view at approximately $1,660 per person if raising medication adherence rates in African-American employees or dependents by 10%. CONCLUSIONS: For the employer business case, both clinical scenarios modeled showed positive results. There is a greater potential financial gain related to eliminating a disparity in asthma medications than there is for eliminating a disparity in mammography rates. © 2011 Nerenz et al. licensee BioMed Central Ltd.;BMC Med Res Methodol. 2011 Mar 19.11:31. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-11-31.;Nerenz DR1, Liu YW, Williams KL, Tunceli K, Zeng H.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Absenteeism,Adolescent,Adult,African Americans,Aged,Asthma/drug therapy,Asthma/economics,Breast Neoplasms/economics,Child,Computer Simulation,Employer Health Costs*,Female,Health Services Accessibility,Health Services Research,Healthcare Disparities/economics*,Humans,Life Expectancy,Mammography/economics,Middle Aged,Models, Theoretical,Prepaid Health Plans,Quality of Health Care,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Young Adult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;A semiparametric censoring bias model for estimating the cumulative risk of a false-positive screening test under dependent censoring.;Abstract False-positive test results are among the most common harms of screening tests and may lead to more invasive and expensive diagnostic testing procedures. Estimating the cumulative risk of a false-positive screening test result after repeat screening rounds is, therefore, important for evaluating potential screening regimens. Existing estimators of the cumulative false-positive risk are limited by strong assumptions about censoring mechanisms and parametric assumptions about variation in risk across screening rounds. To address these limitations, we propose a semiparametric censoring bias model for cumulative false-positive risk that allows for dependent censoring without specifying a fixed functional form for variation in risk across screening rounds. Simulation studies demonstrated that the censoring bias model performs similarly to existing models under independent censoring and can largely eliminate bias under dependent censoring. We used the existing and newly proposed models to estimate the cumulative false-positive risk and variation in risk as a function of baseline age and family history of breast cancer after 10 years of annual screening mammography using data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Ignoring potential dependent censoring in this context leads to underestimation of the cumulative risk of false-positive results. Models that provide accurate estimates under dependent censoring are critical for providing appropriate information for evaluating screening tests.;Biometrics. 2013 Mar.69(1):245-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2012.01831.x.

0;A quantitative method for estimating individual lung cancer risk.;Abstract RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer is caused primarily by repeated exposure to carcinogenic particulate matter and noxious gasses with high particulate deposition localized to airway bifurcations and the lung periphery. The quantitative measurement and analysis of these sites has the potential to stratify lung cancer risk. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the performance of a new method for estimating individual lung cancer risk based on the analysis of airway bifurcations on high-resolution (HR) computed tomographic (CT) scanning and spirometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight subjects with spirometry and thin-slice CT data were selected from a CT screening study including 15 patients with early lung cancer and 93 age-matched and pack-year-matched controls. A subset of seven patients with cancer and 72 controls were scanned with 1-mm CT slice thickness, representing an HR case subset. A quantitative lung cancer risk index method was developed on the basis of airway bifurcation x-ray attenuation combined with the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel and conditional logistic regression tests were used to analyze performance. RESULTS: Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel crude analysis revealed a cancer detection sensitivity and specificity of 67% and 72% for all cases and 100% and 73% for the HR case subset, respectively. Conditional logistic regression showed that a 0.0328 increase in lung cancer risk index was associated with odds ratios of 1.84 (95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.85) for the full data set (P = .0067) and 2.89 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-8.19) for the HR subset (P = .0467). CONCLUSIONS: A preliminary evaluation of a new lung cancer risk estimation method based on thin slice CT and spirometry showed a statistically significant association with lung cancer. 2010 AUR.

0;A quantitative immunochemical fecal occult blood test for colorectal neoplasia.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) for colorectal cancer screening are not specific for human hemoglobin and have low sensitivity. Automated-development, immunochemical FOBT is quality-controlled, is specific for human hemoglobin, and does not require diet restriction. OBJECTIVES: To measure the sensitivity and specificity of quantitative immunochemical fecal hemoglobin measurements for detection of cancer and advanced adenoma in patients undergoing colonoscopy, to determine fecal hemoglobin thresholds that give the highest posttest probability for neoplasia, and to determine the number of immunochemical FOBTs needed. DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Ambulatory endoscopy services of the main health medical organization in Tel Aviv, Israel. PARTICIPANTS: 1000 consecutive ambulatory patients--some asymptomatic but at increased risk for colorectal neoplasia and some symptomatic--who were undergoing elective colonoscopy and volunteered to prepare immunochemical FOBTs. INTERVENTION: The hemoglobin content of 3 bowel movements was measured, and the highest value was compared with colonoscopy findings. MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios, and 95% CIs of fecal hemoglobin measurements for clinically significant neoplasia, their relationship to the amount of fecal hemoglobin measured, and the number of immunochemical FOBTs performed. RESULTS: Colonoscopy identified clinically significant neoplasia in 91 patients (cancer in 17 patients and advanced adenomas in 74 patients). Using 3 immunochemical FOBTs and a hemoglobin threshold of 75 ng/mL of buffer, sensitivity and specificity were 94.1% (95% CI, 82.9% to 100.0%) and 87.5% (CI, 85.4% to 89.6%), respectively, for cancer and 67% (CI, 57.4% to 76.7%) and 91.4% (CI, 89.6% to 93.2%), respectively, for any clinically significant neoplasia. LIMITATIONS: The fecal sampling method is standardized, but the sample size depends on fecal consistency. Some patients were tested while discontinuing aspirin and anticoagulant therapies. Study patients were at increased risk, and results might not apply to average-risk populations. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative immunochemical FOBT has good sensitivity and specificity for detection of clinically significant neoplasia.

METHODS: We apply the statistical method developed by Wu et al. (2007) [1] using the Minnesota colorectal cancer study group data, to make Bayesian inference for the lead time, the time of diagnosis advanced by screening for both male and female participants in a periodic screening program. The lead time is distributed as a mixture of a point mass at zero and a piecewise continuous distribution. The two parts of the mixture correspond to two aspects of the screening: the probability of no benefit, or the percentage of interval cases. and the probability distribution of the early diagnosis time. We present estimates of these two measures for males and females by simulation studies using the Minnesota study group data. We also provide the mean, mode, variance, and density curve of the program's lead time by gender. This may provide policy makers important information on the effectiveness of the FOBT screening in colorectal cancer early detection. RESULTS: The mean lead time increases as the screening time interval decreases for both males and females. The standard error of the lead time also increases as the screening time interval decreases for both genders. Females seem get more benefit than males, in that females usually have a longer lead time than males if both take the test at the same time interval and the lead time mode for females is greater than that of males in the same screening time interval. CONCLUSION: According to the predictive estimation of the lead time distribution, to guarantee a 90% chance of early detection, it seems necessary for the males to take the fecal occult blood test every 9 months, while the females can take it annually.;Cancer Epidemiol. 2009 Oct.33(3-4):212-5. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2009.08.001.

0;A patient-level calibration framework for evaluating surveillance strategies: a case study of mammographic follow-up after early breast cancer.;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Currently all women who have completed their primary treatment for early breast cancer are invited to receive routine annual mammography. There is no randomized controlled trial evidence to support this schedule, and model-based analysis is required. This paper describes a novel data collection and model calibration process to analyze the cost-effectiveness of alternative follow-up schedules for early breast cancer survivors. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model describes the progression of early breast cancer after the completion of primary treatment, representing impalpable and palpable recurrence and the detection of impalpable disease via follow-up mammography. Retrospective data from the South Australian Cancer Registry and clinical and administrative hospital databases were linked for 407 postmenopausal women diagnosed with moderate-prognosis early breast cancer from 2000 to 2008. These data formed the basis of a patient-level probabilistic calibration process. RESULTS: For 50- to 69-year-old survivors, annual follow-up for 5 years, with visits every 2 years thereafter, appears to be cost-effective. For women aged 70 to 79 years at diagnosis, a surveillance schedule similar to general population screening (2 yearly) appears to be most cost-effective if high rates of adherence can be maintained. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the potential value of combining linked, retrospective data and decision analytic modeling to provide estimates of costs and health outcomes that are sufficiently robust to inform cancer clinical guidelines and individual patient decisions regarding appropriate follow-up schedules.

0;A novel and reliable computational intelligence system for breast cancer detection.;Abstract Cancer is the second important morbidity and mortality factor among women and the most incident type is breast cancer. This paper suggests a hybrid computational intelligence model based on unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, i.e., self-organizing map (SOM) and complex-valued neural network (CVNN), for reliable detection of breast cancer. The dataset used in this paper consists of 822 patients with five features (patient's breast mass shape, margin, density, patient's age, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment). The proposed model was used for the first time and can be categorized in two stages. In the first stage, considering the input features, SOM technique was used to cluster the patients with the most similarity. Then, in the second stage, for each cluster, the patient's features were applied to complex-valued neural network and dealt with to classify breast cancer severity (benign or malign). The obtained results corresponding to each patient were compared to the medical diagnosis results using receiver operating characteristic analyses and confusion matrix. In the testing phase, health and disease detection ratios were 94 and 95%, respectively. Accordingly, the superiority of the proposed model was proved and can be used for reliable and robust detection of breast cancer.;Med Biol Eng Comput. 2018 May.56(5):721-732. doi: 10.1007/s11517-017-1721-z.

0;A new method to address verification bias in studies of clinical screening tests: cervical cancer screening assays as an example.;Abstract OBJECTIVES: Studies to evaluate clinical screening tests often face the problem that the gold standard diagnostic approach is costly and/or invasive. It is therefore common to verify only a subset of negative screening tests using the gold standard method. However, undersampling the screen negatives can lead to substantial overestimation of the sensitivity and underestimation of the specificity of the diagnostic test. Our objective was to develop a simple and accurate statistical method to address this verification bias. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We developed a weighted generalized estimating equation approach to estimate, in a single model, the accuracy (eg, sensitivity/specificity) of multiple assays and simultaneously compare results between assays while addressing verification bias. This approach can be implemented using standard statistical software. Simulations were conducted to assess the proposed method. An example is provided using a cervical cancer screening trial that compared the accuracy of human papillomavirus and Pap tests, with histologic data as the gold standard. RESULTS: The proposed approach performed well in estimating and comparing the accuracy of multiple assays in the presence of verification bias. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach is an easy to apply and accurate method for addressing verification bias in studies of multiple screening methods. Copyright � 2014 Elsevier Inc.

0;A natural history model of stage progression applied to breast cancer.;Abstract Invasive breast cancer is commonly staged as local, regional or distant disease. We present a stochastic model of the natural history of invasive breast cancer that quantifies (1) the relative rate that the disease transitions from the local, regional to distant stages, (2) the tumour volume at the stage transitions and (3) the impact of symptom-prompted detection on the tumour size and stage of invasive breast cancer in a population not screened by mammography. By symptom-prompted detection, we refer to tumour detection that results when symptoms appear that prompt the patient to seek clinical care. The model assumes exponential tumour growth and volume-dependent hazard functions for the times to symptomatic detection and stage transitions. Maximum likelihood parameter estimates are obtained based on SEER data on the tumour size and stage of invasive breast cancer from patients who were symptomatically detected in the absence of screening mammography. Our results indicate that the rate of symptom-prompted detection is similar to the rate of transition from the local to regional stage and an order of magnitude larger than the rate of transition from the regional to distant stage. We demonstrate that, in the even absence of screening mammography, symptom-prompted detection has a large effect on reducing the occurrence of distant staged disease at initial diagnosis.;Stat Med. 2007 Feb 10.26(3):581-95.;Plevritis SK1, Salzman P, Sigal BM, Glynn PW.;Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Breast Self-Examination,Disease Progression,Female,Humans,Middle Aged,Models, Biological*,Models, Statistical*,SEER Program,Stochastic Processes,R01 CA82904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,U01 CA097420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;A model to optimize public health care and downstage breast cancer in limited-resource populations in southern Brazil. (Porto Alegre Breast Health Intervention Cohort).;Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a major public health problem, with rising incidence in many regions of the globe. Although mortality has recently dropped in developed countries, death rates are still increasing in some developing countries, as seen in Brazil. Among the reasons for this phenomenon are the lack of structured screening programs, a long waiting period between diagnosis and treatment, and lack of access to health services for a large proportion of the Brazilian population. METHODS AND DESIGN: Since 2004, an intervention study in a cohort of women in Southern Brazil, denominated Porto Alegre Breast Health Intervention Cohort, is being conducted in order to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a model for BC early detection and treatment. In this study, over 4,000 women from underserved communities aged 40 to 69 years are being screened annually with mammography and clinical breast examination performed by a multidisciplinary team, which also involves nutritional counseling and genetic cancer risk assessment. Risk factors for BC development are also being evaluated. Active search of participants by lay community health workers is one of the major features of our program. The accrual of new participants was concluded in 2006 and the study will last for 10 years. The main goal of the study is to demonstrate significant downstaging of BC in an underserved population through proper screening, attaining a higher rate of early-stage BC diagnoses than usually seen in women diagnosed in the Brazilian Public Health System. Preliminary results show a very high BC incidence in this population (117 cases per 100,000 women per year), despite a low prevalence of classical risk factors. DISCUSSION: This study will allow us to test a model of BC early diagnosis and treatment and evaluate its cost-effectiveness in a developing country where the mortality associated with this disease is very high. Also, it might contribute to the evaluation of risk factors in a population with a different ethnic background from that studied in developed countries. If our model is proven effective, it may be replicated in other parts of the globe where BC is also a major public health problem.;BMC Public Health. 2009 Mar 13.9:83. doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-9-83.;Caleffi M1, Ribeiro RA, Duarte Filho DL, Ashton-Prolla P, Bedin AJ Jr, Skonieski GP, Zignani JM, Giacomazzi J, Franco LR, Graudenz M, Pohlmann P, Fernandes JG, Kivitz P, Weber B.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Adult,Brazil/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/ethnology,Cohort Studies,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Early Diagnosis,Female,Humans,Mammography/economics,Mass Screening/economics*,Middle Aged,Models, Economic,Risk Factors,Surveys and Questionnaires;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;A meta-analysis of diabetes mellitus and the risk of prostate cancer.;Abstract BACKGROUND: Studies investigating the association between diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer have reported inconsistent findings. We examined this association by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of the studies published on the subject. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched. Studies investigating the relationship between diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Potential sources of heterogeneity between studies were explored and publication bias was evaluated. Pooled relative risk (RR) was calculated using the random-effects model. Numerous relevant subgroup analyses were also done. RESULTS: We included 19 studies, published between 1971 and 2005, in the meta-analysis and found an inverse association between diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer [RR, 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.76-0.93, P for heterogeneity <or= 0.01]. For cohort studies alone, the RR was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71-0.92, P for heterogeneity <or= 0.01) and for case-control studies alone, the RR was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.72-1.11, P for heterogeneity = 0.02). The significant heterogeneity was mitigated in some of the subgroup analyses. For studies conducted before prostate-specific antigen screening was introduced as a common procedure, the RR was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.85-1.03, P for heterogeneity = 0.15), and for studies conducted after this time, the RR was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.64-0.83, P for heterogeneity = 0.10). For studies that adjusted for three or more potential confounders, the RR was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.65-0.85, P for heterogeneity = 0.06) and for studies that adjusted for less than three potential confounders, the RR was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.86-1.02, P for heterogeneity = 0.18). CONCLUSION: This study suggests an inverse relationship between diabetes and prostate cancer. Potential biological mechanisms underlying this association, as well as possible biases, are discussed.;Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2006 Nov.15(11):2056-62.;Kasper JS1, Giovannucci E.;Meta-Analysis,Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural,Cohort Studies,Diabetes Complications/diagnosis*,Diabetes Complications/pathology,Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis*,Diabetes Mellitus/pathology,Humans,Male,Models, Statistical,Prostatic Neoplasms/complications*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology,Research Design,Risk,CA009001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;A Markov model of the natural history of prostate cancer.;Abstract The objective of this study was to lay a foundation for future cost-benefit analyses evaluating the public health impact of treatment and screening protocols for prostate cancer. Specifically we wanted to define the relative impact on cancer-specific mortality rates of the individual epidemiological components: pathological incidences by age groups, cancer progression rates, and the effect of competing causes of death, assuming expectant management (i.e. no definitive treatment). A biological model of prostate cancer incidence and progression was converted into a standard Markov tree where competing causes of death could occur. Weighted averages of progression rates were obtained from clinical studies. Separate cohorts of 30 year old black and white men were followed for 50 years. The model yielded cancer-specific mortality rates, overall mortality rates, and pathologic prevalences for both white and black males, consistent with the literature. Sensitivity analyses showed that of all the parameters studied, the pathological incidence of cancer in men under 50 years of age had the greatest impact on the cancer-specific mortality rates. Also important was the annual probability of progression of A1 lesions. However the other parameters including pathological incidence in older males, and progression from locally-extensive to metastatic lesions had much smaller effects. In summary, this model correlates the clinical literature with the epidemiology of prostate cancer and can be used for further decision analyses. We recommend that future research be done to more precisely quantify the pathological incidence of prostate cancer in men under 50-60 years of age. More certainty is also needed before generalizing the results of relatively small A1 series to millions of men, since A1 progression rates critically affect the eventual cancer-specific mortality. Enough uncertainty remains at this point however, that we cannot advocate widespread screening for prostate cancer until its merit be demonstrated either by the definitive long term study, or by examination of costs and quality-of-life-adjusted benefits.;J Clin Epidemiol. 1994 Jan.47(1):3-21.;Cowen ME1, Chartrand M, Weitzel WF.;Adult,African Continental Ancestry Group,Age Factors,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cohort Studies,Computer Simulation,Decision Support Techniques,European Continental Ancestry Group,Humans,Incidence,Male,Markov Chains*,Middle Aged,Models, Biological*,Prevalence,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology*,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;A general binomial regression model to estimate standardized risk differences from binary response data.;Abstract Estimates of absolute risks and risk differences are necessary for evaluating the clinical and population impact of biomedical research findings. We have developed a linear-expit regression model (LEXPIT) to incorporate linear and nonlinear risk effects to estimate absolute risk from studies of a binary outcome. The LEXPIT is a generalization of both the binomial linear and logistic regression models. The coefficients of the LEXPIT linear terms estimate adjusted risk differences, whereas the exponentiated nonlinear terms estimate residual odds ratios. The LEXPIT could be particularly useful for epidemiological studies of risk association, where adjustment for multiple confounding variables is common. We present a constrained maximum likelihood estimation algorithm that ensures the feasibility of risk estimates of the LEXPIT model and describe procedures for defining the feasible region of the parameter space, judging convergence, and evaluating boundary cases. Simulations demonstrate that the methodology is computationally robust and yields feasible, consistent estimators. We applied the LEXPIT model to estimate the absolute 5-year risk of cervical precancer or cancer associated with different Pap and human papillomavirus test results in 167,171 women undergoing screening at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The LEXPIT model found an increased risk due to abnormal Pap test in human papillomavirus-negative that was not detected with logistic regression. Our R package blm provides free and easy-to-use software for fitting the LEXPIT model.;Stat Med. 2013 Feb 28.32(5):808-21. doi: 10.1002/sim.5553.

1;A cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for carcinoma of the prostate by digital examination.;Abstract While screening for carcinoma of the prostate by digital examination has been promoted as low in cost, safe, and effective, recent reviews have questioned its cost-effectiveness. Critical analysis has been lacking because of limited understanding of the preclinical phase of the disease and because of the absence of pertinent large-cohort data. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of digital examination for prostate cancer using computer simulation of a large-cohort study. The simulation allowed for study of variations in critical assumptions about the disease and the screening procedure and keeps track of outcome descriptors such as total cost of the screening program and total years of life saved over the life of the cohort. Under assumptions favoring demonstrations of benefit from screening, modest increases in life expectancy were found in direct proportion to frequency and increasing costs of screening.;Med Decis Making. 1985 Fall.5(3):263-78.;Love RR, Fryback DG, Kimbrough SR.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.,Aged,Biopsy/economics,Cost-Benefit Analysis*,Humans,Male,Models, Theoretical,Palpation,Physical Examination/economics*,Prostatic Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality,Software,K07-CA00721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R18-CA16405/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States,R25-CA18397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;A computer model for the study of breast cancer.;Abstract A computer model was designed as a relational database to assess breast cancer screening in a cohort of women where the growth and development of breast cancer originates with the first malignant cell. The concepts of thresholds for growth, axillary spread, and distant sites are integrated. With tumor diagnosis, staging was performed that includes clinical and sub-clinical states. The model was parameterized to have staging characteristics similar to data published by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) Program. Validation was accomplished by comparing simulated staging results with non-SEER sources, and simulated survival with independent clinical survival data.;Comput Biol Med. 2003 Jul.33(4):345-60.;Carter KJ1, Castro F, Kessler E, Erickson B.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/mortality,Breast Neoplasms/pathology*,Computer Simulation*,Female,Humans,Incidence,Life Expectancy,Lymphatic Metastasis,Neoplasm Metastasis,SEER Program,Software,United States/epidemiology;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;A comprehensive non-invasive framework for diagnosing prostate cancer.;Abstract Early detection of prostate cancer increases chances of patients' survival. Our automated non-invasive system for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of prostate cancer segments the prostate on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRI) acquired at different b-values, estimates its apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC), and classifies their descriptors - empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDF) - with a trained deep learning network. To segment the prostate, an evolving geometric (level-set-based) deformable model is guided by a speed function depending on intensity attributes extracted from the DW-MRI with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). For a more robust evolution, the attributes are fused with a probabilistic shape prior and estimated spatial dependencies between prostate voxels. To preserve continuity, the ADCs of the segmented prostate volume at different b-values are normalized and refined using a generalized Gauss-Markov random field image model. The CDFs of the refined ADCs at different b-values are considered global water diffusion features and used to distinguish between benign and malignant prostates. A deep learning network of stacked non-negativity-constrained auto-encoders (SNCAE) is trained to classify the benign or malignant prostates on the basis of the constructed CDFs. Our experiments on 53 clinical DW-MRI data sets resulted in 92.3% accuracy, 83.3% sensitivity, and 100% specificity, indicating that the proposed CAD system could be used as a reliable non-invasive diagnostic tool.;Comput Biol Med. 2017 Feb 1.81:148-158. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.12.010.

0;A complete software application for automatic registration of x-ray mammography and magnetic resonance images.;Abstract PURPOSE: This work presents a complete and automatic software application to aid radiologists in breast cancer diagnosis. The application is a fully automated method that performs a complete registration of magnetic resonance (MR) images and x-ray (XR) images in both directions (from MR to XR and from XR to MR) and for both x-ray mammograms, craniocaudal (CC), and mediolateral oblique (MLO). This new approximation allows radiologists to mark points in the MR images and, without any manual intervention, it provides their corresponding points in both types of XR mammograms and vice versa. METHODS: The application automatically segments magnetic resonance images and x-ray images using the C-Means method and the Otsu method, respectively. It compresses the magnetic resonance images in both directions, CC and MLO, using a biomechanical model of the breast that distinguishes the specific biomechanical behavior of each one of its three tissues (skin, fat, and glandular tissue) separately. It makes a projection of both compressions and registers them with the original XR images using affine transformations and nonrigid registration methods. RESULTS: The application has been validated by two expert radiologists. This was carried out through a quantitative validation on 14 data sets in which the Euclidean distance between points marked by the radiologists and the corresponding points obtained by the application were measured. The results showed a mean error of 4.2 ± 1.9 mm for the MRI to CC registration, 4.8 ± 1.3 mm for the MRI to MLO registration, and 4.1 ± 1.3 mm for the CC and MLO to MRI registration. CONCLUSIONS: A complete software application that automatically registers XR and MR images of the breast has been implemented. The application permits radiologists to estimate the position of a lesion that is suspected of being a tumor in an imaging modality based on its position in another different modality with a clinically acceptable error. The results show that the application can accelerate the mammographic screening process for high risk populations or for dense breasts.;Med Phys. 2014 Aug.41(8):081903. doi: 10.1118/1.4885957.;Solves-Llorens JA1, Rupérez MJ1, Monserrat C1, Feliu E2, García M2, Lloret M3.;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Validation Studies,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Algorithms,Breast/pathology,Breast/physiopathology,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/pathology,Computer Simulation,Female,Finite Element Analysis,Humans,Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/methods*,Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods*,Mammography/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Biological,Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods*,Pectoralis Muscles/pathology,Software*;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1;A bayesian random-effects markov model for tumor progression in women with a family history of breast cancer.;Abstract It makes intuitive sense to model the natural history of breast cancer, tumor progression from preclinical screen-detectable phase (PCDP) to clinical disease, as a multistate process, but the multilevel structure of the available data, which generally comes from cluster (family)-based service screening programs, makes the required parameter estimation intractable because there is a correlation between screening rounds in the same individual, and between subjects within clusters (families). There is also residual heterogeneity after adjusting for covariates. We therefore proposed a Bayesian hierarchical multistate Markov model with fixed and random effects and applied it to data from a high-risk group (women with a family history of breast cancer) participating in a family-based screening program for breast cancer. A total of 4867 women attended (representing 4464 families) and by the end of 2002, a total of 130 breast cancer cases were identified. Parameter estimation was carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and the Bayesian software package WinBUGS. Models with and without random effects were considered. Our preferred model included a random-effect term for the transition rate from preclinical to clinical disease (sigma(2)(2f)), which was estimated to be 0.50 (95% credible interval = 0.22-1.49). Failure to account for this random effect was shown to lead to bias. The incorporation of covariates into multistate models with random effect not only reduced residual heterogeneity but also improved the convergence of stationary distribution. Our proposed Bayesian hierarchical multistate model is a valuable tool for estimating the rate of transitions between disease states in the natural history of breast cancer (and possibly other conditions). Unlike existing models, it can cope with the correlation structure of multilevel screening data, covariates, and residual (unexplained) variation.;Biometrics. 2008 Dec.64(4):1231-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1541-0420.2007.00979.x.

0;[The PAPNET system in cytological rescreening of cervical smears].;Abstract BACKGROUND: The Papanicolaou test has reduced mortality from cervical cancer but has not completely eradicated the disease. A reason for the false negative screening errors may be found in one of three steps of the test (obtaining, processing and interpretation of the cervicovaginal smears). The possible false negative primary screening errors may be detected with the help of rescreening. Therefore, an automated quality control by means of a system such as in the PAPNET is necessary. The PAPNET combines the use of algorithmic image analysis with neural networks and allows to conventionally reassess cervicovaginal smears. Nevertheless, the cytopathologist always decides whether to reassess the sample with the optic microscope as suggested by the presence of abnormal cells in the frames selected by the PAPNET system. Therefore the cytopathologist always formulates the conclusive diagnosis. METHODS: In this study, we rescreened 300 cervicovaginal smears. RESULTS: Only 122 smears have been reassessed by the optic microscope. The human papillomavirus infection and the SIL (squamous Intraepithelial Lesion) diagnoses formulated by means of rescreening with the PAPNET have coincided with the primary screening diagnoses. The only exception was a human papillomavirus infection not previously detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the use of the PAPNET system facilitates the quality control measures and has reduced the false negatives.;Minerva Ginecol. 1997 Apr.49(4):139-45.;Cenci M1, Nagar C, Giovagnoli MR, Vecchione A.;English Abstract,False Negative Reactions,Female,Humans,Neural Networks (Computer),Papanicolaou Test*,Quality Control,Vaginal Smears*/instrumentation,Vaginal Smears*/standards;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Inverse-probability weighting method was used to adjust the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests, with an example of cervical cancer screening used to introduce the Compare Tests package in R software which could be implemented. Sensitivity and specificity calculated from the traditional method and maximum likelihood estimation method were compared to the results from Inverse-probability weighting method in the random-sampled example. The true sensitivity and specificity of the HPV self-sampling test were 83.53% (95%CI:74.23-89.93)and 85.86% (95%CI: 84.23-87.36). In the analysis of data with randomly missing verification by gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity calculated by traditional method were 90.48% (95%CI:80.74-95.56)and 71.96% (95%CI:68.71-75.00), respectively. The adjusted sensitivity and specificity under the use of Inverse-probability weighting method were 82.25% (95% CI:63.11-92.62) and 85.80% (95% CI: 85.09-86.47), respectively, whereas they were 80.13% (95%CI:66.81-93.46)and 85.80% (95%CI: 84.20-87.41) under the maximum likelihood estimation method. The inverse-probability weighting method could effectively adjust the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test when verification bias existed, especially when complex sampling appeared.;Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Mar.35(3):329-32.;Kang L1, Zhang S1, Zhao F1, Qiao Y2.;English Abstract,Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures*,Female,Humans,Likelihood Functions*,Sensitivity and Specificity,Software*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1;[Effectiveness and health economic analysis of strategies on cervical cancer screening and early diagnosis and treatment].;Abstract OBJECTIVE: To explore the appropriate strategies which are suitable for the areas with diverse health and economic resource settings in China by estimating the life outcomes and cost-effectiveness of several cervical cancer screening strategies. METHODS: Markov model was used to calculate the long-term effectiveness, utility, benefit and cost among screened and unscreened cohorts in rural and urban areas, and then analyses of cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit were performed. The assessed screening strategies were acetic acid of visual inspection combined with Lugol's iodine staining (VIA/VILI), conventional Pap smear and simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV) in rural areas, and conventional Pap smear, simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV), HPV DNA testing (HC2) and liquid-based cytology (LBC) alone or combined with HPV DNA testing (LBC+HC2) in urban areas. We estimated the life outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the above screening strategies at one-year, 3-year and 5-year intervals. RESULTS: All of the screening strategies were effective to decrease cervical cancer mortality and to increase life years, with a trend of shorter screening interval having better effectiveness. However, no matter in urban or rural areas, compared with careHPV testing at 5-year interval, the costs of other screening strategies were 1.28 - 13.86 folds, 1.31 - 14.14 folds, and 1.27 - 12.80 folds higher to avoid one death, to save a year of life, and a QALY, and the benefit per cost of other screening strategies was 9.9%-90.2%. CONCLUSIONS: careHPV testing at 5-year interval has the best cost-effectiveness performance and the highest benefit-cost ratio with the moderate life outcomes. It is the optimal cervical cancer screening strategy to be generalized in our country. careHPV testing at 3 years interval can be considered in more developed areas to achieve better effectiveness.;Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2012 Aug.34(8):632-6. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-3766.2012.08.017.;Zhao FH1, Chen JF, Gao XH, Gao LM, Liu QG, Liu ZH, Xu H, Ma JF, Ma L, Xu XL, Hu SY, Ning Y, Shi JF, Qiao YL.;English Abstract,Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't,Acetic Acid,Adult,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/diagnosis,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/economics,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/epidemiology,Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia/virology,China/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Cytological Techniques,DNA, Viral/analysis,Early Detection of Cancer/economics,Early Detection of Cancer/methods*,Female,Human Papillomavirus DNA Tests,Humans,Iodides,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Models, Biological,Models, Statistical,Papanicolaou Test,Quality-Adjusted Life Years,Rural Population,Urban Population,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/economics*,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology,Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/virology,Vaginal Smears,DNA, Viral,Iodides,Acetic Acid,Lugol's solution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1,106 women with breast cancer were approached in health care institutions of Bogota, Colombia. According to the history of first consultation, we established diagnostic and treatment incidence rates, which were compared for different variables. A Cox hazard model was established. RESULTS: Median time from first consultation to diagnosis and start of treatment were 91 days (CI95%:82-97 days) and 137 days (CI95%:127-147 days) respectively. Diagnosis and treatment were faster in women with higher educational level, affiliated to the special social security, with better socioeconomic conditions and in screening-detected breast cancers. CONCLUSION: Provider delay is excessive. There are clear inequities in access to services and a need of reducing the waiting times for women with a suspicion of breast cancer.;Salud Publica Mex. 2011 Nov-Dec.53(6):478-85.;Piñeros M1, Sánchez R, Perry F, García OA, Ocampo R, Cendales R.;English Abstract,Adult,Aged,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Breast Neoplasms/therapy*,Colombia/epidemiology,Delayed Diagnosis*,Female,Health Status Disparities*,Health Surveys,Humans,Insurance Coverage/standards,Mass Screening,Middle Aged,Proportional Hazards Models,Socioeconomic Factors,Time Factors;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;[Cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening policies in Mexico].;Abstract OBJECTIVE: Generate cost-effectiveness information to allow policy makers optimize breast cancer (BC) policy in Mexico. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov model that incorporates four interrelated processes of the disease: the natural history. detection using mammography. treatment. and other competing-causes mortality, according to which 13 different strategies were modeled. RESULTS: Strategies (starting age, % of coverage, frequency in years)= (48, 25, 2), (40, 50, 2) and (40, 50, 1) constituted the optimal method for expanding the BC program, yielding 75.3, 116.4 and 171.1 thousand pesos per life-year saved, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The strategies included in the optimal method for expanding the program produce a cost per life-year saved of less than two times the GNP per capita and hence are cost-effective according to WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health criteria.;Salud Publica Mex. 2009.51 Suppl 2:s296-304.;Valencia-Mendoza A1, Sánchez-González G, Bautista-Arredondo S, Torres-Mejía G, Bertozzi SM.;English Abstract,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Breast Neoplasms/economics*,Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Health Policy,Humans,Markov Chains,Mass Screening/economics*,Mexico,Middle Aged;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1;[Colorectal cancer screening: advice from the Health Council of the Netherlands].;Abstract There is sufficient evidence that a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programme is feasible, acceptable and cost-effective amongst the Dutch population. This is the conclusion of the Health Council of the Netherlands in an advisory report to the Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport. It also concluded that an immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) would be the obvious screening method. The recommended target group is men and women aged 55-75. An evaluation of the randomized pilot trials in the regions of Nijmegen, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam predicted a participation rate of 60%. Based on the analyses from a microsimulation model, biennial screening for CRC with iFOBT and an uptake rate of 60% could prevent 1400 deaths from CRC per annum, at a cost of 2200 euros per years of life saved.;Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 2009.153:A1441.;van Veen W1, Mali WP.;English Abstract,Aged,Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis*,Colorectal Neoplasms/economics,Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality,Cost-Benefit Analysis,Female,Humans,Male,Mass Screening/economics*,Mass Screening/methods*,Middle Aged,Netherlands,Occult Blood*,Sensitivity and Specificity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
0;[Anti-tumor target prediction and activity verification of Ganoderma lucidum triterpenoids].;Abstract It has reported that Ganoderma lucidum triterpenoids had anti-tumor activity. However, the anti-tumor target is still unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the anti-tumor activity of G. lucidum triterpenoids on different tumor cells, and predict their potential targets by virtual screening. In this experiment, molecular docking was used to simulate the interactions of 26 triterpenoids isolated from G. lucidum and 11 target proteins by LibDock module of Discovery Studio2016 software, then the anti-tumor targets of triterpenoids were predicted. In addition, the in vitro anti-tumor effects of triterpenoids were evaluated by MTT assay by determining the inhibition of proliferation in 5 tumor cell lines. The docking results showed that the poses were greater than five, and Libdock Scores higher than 100, which can be used to determine whether compounds were activity. Eight triterpenoids might have anti-tumor activity as a result of good docking, five of which had multiple targets. MTT experiments demonstrated that the ganoderic acid Y had a certain inhibitory activity on lung cancer cell H460, with IC₅₀ of 22.4 μmol•L ⁻¹, followed by 7-oxo-ganoderic acid Z2, with IC₅₀ of 43.1 μmol•L ⁻¹. However, the other triterpenoids had no anti-tumor activity in the detected tumor cell lines. Taking together, molecular docking approach established here can be used for preliminary screening of anti-tumor activity of G.lucidum ingredients. Through this screening method, combined with the MTT assay, we can conclude that ganoderic acid Y had antitumor activity, especially anti-lung cancer, and 7-oxo-ganoderic acid Z2 as well as ganoderon B, to a certain extent, had anti-tumor activity. These findings can provide basis for the development of anti-tumor drugs. However, the anti-tumor mechanisms need to be further studied.;Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. 2017 Feb.42(3):517-522. doi: 10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20161222.069.;Du GH1, Wang HX1, Yan Z1, Liu LY2, Chen RY2.;Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology*,Cell Line, Tumor,Humans,Molecular Docking Simulation,Reishi/chemistry*,Triterpenes/pharmacology*,Antineoplastic Agents,Triterpenes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
